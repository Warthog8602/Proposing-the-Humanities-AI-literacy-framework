In this strategic relation between education and communication, public policies should strengthen a framework that encourages personal empowerment, combining creativity with understanding of the structures, processes and techniques that enhance critical consumption. This paper offers an overview of the advances that have occurred with regard to the new media literacy, based on content analysis, from the definition of this concept by UNESCO in 1979 to the present, through New Curriculum for Teachers on Media and Information Literacy of 2011 and Mapping Media Education in the World of 2009. Additionally, we deal with the main discussions held in a global context because it is imperative to reinforce the value of diversity in the face of the great convergence challenge. The empowerment of citizenship is an unquestionable value that will be beneficial to their cultural inclusion and their critical participation in the media sphere, so that they become media and digital prosumers, and to this effect public policies in education and communication must continue advancing and joining efforts.","UNIV RAMON LLULL, FAC CIENCIES COMUNICACIO BLANQUERNA",2020,,,,,

Malaysian pupils have been achieving English proficiency level lower than the set expectation. This is further highlighted in the 2016 Economic Planning Unit report that after finishing Year 6 of Malaysian primary education, less than half of the students achieved a reasonable level of English literacy. Given the significance of vocabulary knowledge to language proficiency, the present study sought to examine the use of images in Malaysian ESL classrooms in terms of its effects on the development of vocabulary knowledge among Year One pupils'. The study is different from previous studies and exploratory in nature, in the sense that it examined not only receptive vocabulary knowledge but also the productive aspect of vocabulary learning. Two groups of Malaysian Year One pupils from a national primary school in Malaysia were selected by purposive sampling for a pretest-posttest-delayed posttest design in a quasi-experimental approach. The Experimental group experienced the interventional approach (use of images) while the Control group did not. Results revealed superior productive vocabulary scores, at both the posttest and delayed posttest levels, in favour of the Experimental group. No significant difference was recorded for the receptive dimension. One other finding is that the testing instruments used were statistically found to be reliable for use with Malaysian Year One pupils. This study and its findings are of relevance to policymakers, educators, curriculum designers, and scholars engaged in ESL/EFL research pertaining to young learners.",UNIV PUTRA MALAYSIA PRESS,2020,,,,,

While acknowledging that the 4IR will impact on everything, everywhere, including research and libraries, we conceptualize 4IR, and we compare current academic library services/trends in South Africa with 4IR requirements, through the analysis of 26 public university library websites. Design/methodology/approach Besides conceptualization of 4IR, a content analysis of websites of 26 public universities' libraries in South Africa was achieved followed up with verification of the data by respective libraries through a preliminary research report circulated to them by email. 23 areas were identified as the trends in academic libraries, which included free Wi-Fi in the libraries; 24/7 study areas and access to library resources on and off campus; research commons; makerspace; borrowing ICTs (e.g. laptops); e-resources; e-catalogues; research data services (RDS; RDM, IR); open scholarship; information literacy and reference/bibliographic tools, library as a publisher, among others. Data obtained were captured in Excel and analyzed by the research questions. Findings The 4IR concept does not occur often in literature, in relation to academic libraries, but it is implied. The findings show that the libraries are responding well to the revolution through their services, with remarkable innovation and creativity on display. There was a 64% presence of the analyzed trends/services in the libraries, with emerging trends/services such as library as a publisher (4%), robotics/AI (4%), makerspace (8%), RDS (27%), borrowing of ICTs/devices (19%) and user experience (19%) scoring low, while information literacy and digital scholarship (e.g. IR) (88%), e-catalogue and e-resources (92%), group study area (85%) and off campus access (77%) scoring above 75%. The scatter of the trends/services among the university libraries is noted for knowledge sharing of best practice. Research limitations/implications In order to improve accordance with trends, academic libraries have to be better resourced, accessed and used, as well as improve web visibility. The study expects library services to be responsive, resourced and accessible anytime and anywhere, and it provides a conceptual framework and a benchmark for further research and exploration in the country, region and perhaps elsewhere. Practical implications The study can be used for benchmarking current and future academic library services in Africa. The conceptual framework provides an agenda for theoretical discussions and deliberations. Social implications The trends, framework and 4IR representations in the study can inform theory and practice in LIS, particularly in Africa. Originality/value Linking 4IR to current and future library services provides a tool for academic libraries services benchmarking and development and provides a conceptual framework for theoretical and practical debates and implementation. The study is quite current and appropriate for the ongoing discussions of 4IR implications to academic libraries.",EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/LM-04-2020-0067,,,,

In this media transformation, artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced, adapted to social networks for various purposes, including political ones. This work focuses on AI in bot format as an automated tool to publish content on Twitter and on the skills needed to identify them. Bots seek to imitate human behaviour to create a climate of concrete opinion, participate in political conversations and interact with real accounts in order to boycott them or increase their relevance. In order to know the level of media literacy of journalism students and increase their skills to identify this type of manipulation of the public sphere, a teaching intervention is designed at university level, applied to a sample of 55 students, consisting of a workshop to identify bots on Twitter. From the results of the workshop, evaluated through questionnaires, it is observed that the students have previous skills acquired informally to detect bots and that after the workshop the ability to identify these accounts slightly increases and, above all, they manifest a more conscious process when they face them.

As such, recent nationally representative data, such as the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), could help assess the current level of HIV testing among young people, a key target population for HIV prevention in the country. In this study, we examined the coverage and factors associated with HIV testing among adolescents and young adults (AYA). Methods We used the data for 14,312 AYA that examined recent and lifetime HIV testing from the 2017 MCIS. Our outcomes of interest were ever tested for HIV and recently tested for HIV. We examined the association between socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, marital status, education attainment, wealth status), stigma belief, exposure to media and HIV knowledge, and uptake of HIV testing using adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression models. Results Less than a quarter of the AYA (23.7%) had ever tested for HIV, and an even lower proportion (12.4%) tested in the year preceding the survey. More females (25.4%) compared to males (20.8%) had ever tested for HIV. Young people who were aged 20-24 years (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.34-1.72), married (AOR 2.42, 95% CI 1.98-2.97), had higher educational attainment (AOR 5.85, 95% CI 4.39-7.81), and belonged to the wealthiest quintile (AOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.53-2.60), had higher odds of having ever tested for HIV compared to those aged 15-19 years, never married, had no formal education and belonged to the poorest wealth quintile. Also, those who had positive stigma belief towards people living with HIV (AOR 2.93, 95% CI 2.47-3.49), had higher HIV knowledge (AOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.24-2.11), and higher media exposure (AOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.36-1.97), had higher odds of having ever tested compared to those who had more negative stigma belief, had low knowledge of HIV and low media exposure. Conclusion The HIV testing coverage among AYA in Nigeria is well below the national target of 95% indicated in the national HIV/AIDS strategic framework (2017-2021). Also, the low rate of HIV testing found in this study means realising the UNAIDS first 95 will require interventions targeting AYA. These interventions should focus on improving young people's knowledge of HIV, reducing negative stigma belief through media campaigns and increasing access to HIV testing through home-based testing and opt-out strategy at the point of care.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233368,,,,

Where many AI processes are technologies hidden from view of the citizen, how can public institutions support and ensure these high levels of trust, transparency, and openness in Nordic culture and extend these concepts of digital trust to AI? One solution is by authoring national policy that upholds cultural values and personal rights, ultimately reinforcing these values in their societies. The paper highlights differences in how Nordic nations position themselves using cultural values as organizing principles, with the author showing these values (i.e., trust through clear information and information security, transparency through AI literacy education and clear algorithmic decision making, and openness by creating data lakes and data trusts) support the development of AI technology in society. The analysis shows that three cultural values are upheld and influence Nordic national AI strategies, while themes of privacy, ethics, and autonomy are present, and democracy, a societal building block in the Nordics, is especially prominent in the policies. For policy development, policy leaders must understand that without citizen involvement in AI implementation or lacking citizen AI education, we risk alienating those for who these services are meant to utilize and improve access for.",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101421,,,,

We applied a novel statistical approach to identify clusters of individuals with distinct patterns of change in declarative memory in HIV-seropositive (HIV+) and HIV-seronegative (HIV-) women. Methods 1731 women from the Women's Interagency HIV Study, a multi-center, prospective cohort study, completed the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HLVT-R) at 2 visits. To derive subgroups with similar patterns of decline by HIV-serostatus, we used a mixed-effects framework that modeled the trajectory of multiple declarative memory outcomes over time, while simultaneously clustering individuals. Results Of the 1731 participants, 1149 were HIV+ (70% Black/African American [AA]; 30% White/Other [W/O]) and 582 were HIV- (68% AA; 32% W/O). Race stratification was necessary to optimize clustering. Among HIV+AA's, four subgroups emerged: a subgroup with minimal decline, two with accelerated decline, and one with stable but low performance. In HIV- AA, three subgroups emerged: one with minimal decline and two with accelerated decline. In multivariable-adjusted models among HIV+, individuals with accelerated decline were less educated (P < 0.001) and more likely to have a history of depression (P < 0.001) versus those with minimal decline. Similar subgroups were identified in W/O HIV+ and W/O HIV- participants. Conclusion We identified clinically meaningful subgroups of women with distinct phenotypes of declarative memory decline, which depend on race and HIV-serostatus using a data driven approach. Identification of underlying mechanisms and risk factors contributing to the observed differences are warranted. More broadly our modeling approach could be other populations to identify risk factors for accelerated cognitive decline and to personalize interventions.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.548521,,,,

In this study, a human-robot interaction application is designed to help primary school children learn both a newly-adopted script and also its handwriting system. The setup involved an experiment with 62 children between the ages of 7-9 years old, across three conditions: a robot and a tablet, a tablet only, and a teacher. Based on the paradigm-learning by teaching-the study showed that children improved their knowledge of the Latin script by interacting with a robot.

We review existing literature, discuss the educational game design and development of ArtBot and describe the initial feedback of students and teachers. Our goal is to provide insights and suggest guidelines for the implementation of game-based learning environments for supporting AI literacy skills of students.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3459990.3465176,,,,

These deepfakes are undetectable thanks to their components, which heightens concerns about the distortion of reality in the information ecosystem and how the ability to distinguish between real and fake audiovisual content affects public trust and democratic systems. This is a major challenge for media and information literacy if it is to combat misinformation effectively. In this context, this study presents the results of a quasi-experiment conducted with 80 young people from the Community of Madrid (Spain) to assess their ability to detect deepfakes in immersive environments and to establish whether the context-identifying elements that enable detection of the reputation of the media source shape the credibility of the images. The results show that the images take precedence over the context identifiers, preventing a critical reading of the information that would make it possible to detect visual forgeries, something that is reinforced by their exceptional verisimilitude. It is concluded that the new post-humanist biome of virtual reality and artificial intelligence requires a reorientation of media and information literacy to raise the public's awareness and educate them to make them less susceptible to disinformation based on deepfakes created with generative models.","UNIV NAVARRA, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONES",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.15581/003.37.4.223-239,,,,

Consequently there has been an increased effort to teach basic concepts of AI and machine learning (ML) from an early age. Digital games have been shown to be effective as teaching and learning tools, and there are ongoing efforts to increase AI literacy through educational digital games. To this effect, this work describes the process followed to extrapolate the design of such an educational game directly from the pedagogical needs emerging from stakeholders. Seven focus groups and workshops were conducted in Greece, Malta and Norway, with 55 teachers, researchers, practitioners and policy-makers, and 22 primary and secondary education students in total. These workshops identified seven goals which informed the design of a game for AI literacy called ArtBot. The game design process and the final interface and gameplay loop of ArtBot are explained in relation to these goals. The game was subsequently deployed across a variety of platforms, to enable dissemination to a broad audience in classrooms and elsewhere. The game was part of the tools developed in the framework of the LearnML Erasmus+ project. A preliminary online survey was used to gauge how well the game was received by teachers and students, with an overall positive result. A longer-term data collection of the game usage statistics has been initiated and will be analysed over the course of the game dissemination.",ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.34190/GBL.21.155,,,,

Regarding the increasing importance of AI, literacy concepts need to be extended to account for AI-related specifics. The easy handling of the systems results in increased usage, contrasting limited conceptualizations (e.g., imagination of future importance) and competencies (e.g., knowledge about functional principles). In reference to voice-based conversational agents as a concrete application of AI, the present paper aims for the development of a measurement to assess the conceptualizations and competencies about conversational agents. In a first step, a theoretical framework of AI literacy is transferred to the context of conversational agent literacy. Second, the conversational agent literacy scale (short CALS) is developed, constituting the first attempt to measure interindividual differences in the (il) literate usage of conversational agents. 29 items were derived, of which 170 participants answered. An explanatory factor analysis identified five factors leading to five subscales to assess CAL: storage and transfer of the smart speaker's data input; smart speaker's functional principles; smart speaker's intelligent functions, learning abilities; smart speaker's reach and potential; smart speaker's technological (surrounding) infrastructure. Preliminary insights into construct validity and reliability of CALS showed satisfying results. Third, using the newly developed instrument, a student sample's CAL was assessed, revealing intermediated values. Remarkably, owning a smart speaker did not lead to higher CAL scores, confirming our basic assumption that usage of systems does not guarantee enlightened conceptualizations and competencies. In sum, the paper contributes to the first insights into the operationalization and understanding of CAL as a specific subdomain of AI-related competencies.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2021.685277,,,,

This has led to a fundamental transformation in the communications not only of businesses but also of governments, organizations, and communities. This study addresses web personalization with an emphasis on artificial intelligence in the context of their use for managing and decision-making in marketing processes in practice. These two techniques tend to be often confused in practice, and for this reason it is helpful to define their positions and mutual interactions. The goal of this article is a theoretical comparison of web personalization and artificial intelligence as part of marketing processes and the proposal of a framework for their use for creators of any online media content. At the same time it sheds light on the meaning and use of web personalization for management in practice and in particular in marketing processes and proposes a model for implementing these techniques that can be used in strategic marketing. This article presents research questions and uses secondary data analysis in the form of literature review and content analysis. The result is categorization of web personalization and artificial intelligence techniques, identifying their mutual links, and proposing an application framework for marketing practice. This article contributes to the discussion by identifying managerial use of defined techniques and their position in strategies for producers of online content and offers a new perspective on the interaction of personalization and artificial intelligence, whereas this approach has not been sufficiently explored in the academic literature.","UNIV SS CYRIL & METHODIUS TRNAVA, FAC MASS MEDIA COMMUNICATION",2021,,,,,

HCPs described barriers that resonated with the COM-B behaviour change framework. Capability-related issues stemmed from a need for specific self-management skills training. Opportunity-related barriers included the need to balance competing tasks and limited, poorly tailored resources. Motivation-related barriers included lack of awareness about self-management benefits, which was not prioritised in consultations with perceived lack of receptiveness from patients. These were compounded by contextual barriers of the healthcare organisation and multilingual society.

Health literacy plays a pivotal role in health behaviors. Sources and types of health information could shape health literacy and inform the Pap testing behaviors of AI women. However, the influences of health literacy, sources, and types of health information along with cultural and psychosocial correlates on the Pap testing behaviors of AI women are poorly understood. To examine how sources and types of health information impact health literacy, and in turn, how health literacy and cultural and psychosocial factors influence the Pap testing behaviors of AI women. An adapted Health Literacy Skills Framework guided the selection of variables for this cross-sectional study. Convenience sampling was used to recruit 167 AI women, 21-65 years. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess correlates of Pap testing after adjusting for covariates (age, education, English proficiency, employment, income, health insurance, access to primary care, marital status, and healthcare provider recommendation). Most participants (71%) had received a Pap test in the past and used multiple (two or more) sources (65%) and types (57%) of health information. Using multiple sources of health information (aOR 0.11, p < 0.01) but not types of health information was associated with Pap testing. Having negative cultural beliefs (aOR 0.17, p = 0.01) and having high self-efficacy (aOR 9.38, p < 0.01) were significantly associated with Pap testing after adjusting for covariates. High health literacy (OR 3.23, p < 0.05) and high decisional balance (OR 5.28, p < 0.001) were associated with Pap testing in bivariate models but did not remain significant after controlling for covariates. Cultural beliefs was a significant correlate of AI women's Pap testing behaviors regardless of other known social determinants of health (education, English proficiency, age, access to primary care). Disseminating health information through various sources has the potential to promote Pap testing among AI women. Larger studies which utilize a robust sampling strategy and include a diverse group of AI women are needed in order to optimize health interventions aimed at improving Pap test screening behaviors among AI women.",SPRINGER,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13187-020-01755-9,,,,

To compensate for this, some governments show an interest in teaching it from an early age. It appears that educational resources related to AI literacy in schools are most often focused on technical skills. However, the challenges of such education are also ethical and societal, requiring an interdisciplinary and critical approach. This research aims at developing a 10-14 years old curriculum questioning the concept of intelligence in AI systems, and crossing computer science education and media literacy education. Through a role-playing game, the children discover the basic concepts of machine learning. Beyond their initial representations, which they become aware that they are largely fueled by the media, they can realize that an AI system is the result of design choices and that it only works within the framework that has been defined for it. Moreover, the possibility for teachers to teach the curriculum themselves in their classes is also evaluated. To this end, the curriculum was taught to 60 future trainee teachers, 70 middle school pupils, and 12 elementary pupils. Interviews were conducted also with 5 teachers who had either observed the curriculum taught by a researcher or attempted to teach it themselves. The results show that the children's representations have evolved towards representations that are more technically correct (although incomplete), but not very oriented towards aspects that open up critical questioning. The difficulties revealed in the implementation of the critical part are due in particular to the complexity of the IT concepts to be addressed, but also to the lack of teacher training. However, the data collected seems to confirm the interest and feasibility of crossing different disciplinary approaches to address certain aspects of AI. In conclusion, in addition to the curriculum, this paper describes a theoretical model of critical citizenship education in technology that integrates approaches to computer science education and media literacy education, and gives avenues for other designers and researchers to create AI critical educational experiences for K-12 learners.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13218-021-00733-7,,,,

However, medical education has not kept pace with the rapid advancements of AI. Despite several calls to action, the adoption of teaching on AI in undergraduate medical education (UME) has been limited. This scoping review aims to identify gaps and key themes in the peer-reviewed literature on AI training in UME. Method The scoping review was informed by Arksey and O'Malley's methodology. Seven electronic databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for articles discussing the inclusion of AI in UME between January 2000 and July 2020. A total of 4,299 articles were independently screened by 3 co-investigators and 22 full-text articles were included. Data were extracted using a standardized checklist. Themes were identified using iterative thematic analysis. Results The literature addressed: (1) a need for an AI curriculum in UME, (2) recommendations for AI curricular content including machine learning literacy and AI ethics, (3) suggestions for curriculum delivery, (4) an emphasis on cultivating uniquely human skills such as empathy in response to AI-driven changes, and (5) challenges with introducing an AI curriculum in UME. However, there was considerable heterogeneity and poor consensus across studies regarding AI curricular content and delivery. Conclusions Despite the large volume of literature, there is little consensus on what and how to teach AI in UME. Further research is needed to address these discrepancies and create a standardized framework of competencies that can facilitate greater adoption and implementation of a standardized AI curriculum in UME.",LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000004291,,,,

Method: We analyzed child-, father-, mother- and teacher-rated attention-problems (N = 38,024), and standardized measures of intelligence (N = 10,273) and educational achievement (N = 17,522) of children from four Dutch population-based cohorts. The mean age over cohorts varied from 9.73-13.03. Most participants were of Dutch origin, ranging from 58.7%-96.7% over cohorts. We analyzed 50% of the data to generate hypotheses and the other 50% to evaluate support for these hypotheses. We aggregated the results over cohorts with Bayesian research synthesis. Results: We mostly found negative linear relations between parental age and attention-problems, meaning that offspring of younger parents tended to have more attention problems. Maternal age was positively and linearly related to offspring's IQ and educational achievement. Paternal age showed an attenuating positive relation with educational achievement and an inverted U-shape relation with IQ, with offspring of younger and older fathers at a disadvantage. Only the associations with maternal age remained after including SES. The inclusion of child gender in the model did not affect the relation between parental age and the study outcomes. Conclusions: Effects were small but significant, with better outcomes for children born to older parents. Older parents tended to be of higher SES. Indeed, the positive relation between parental age and offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes was partly confounded by SES.","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15374416.2020.1756298,,,,

These environments, however, may also lead to privacy and security violations. Moreover, there is usually a trade-off between the benefits gained and the accompanying costs. Due to the uncertain nature of the information-sharing environment and the lack of technological literacy, the layperson user often fails miserably in balancing this trade-off. In this paper, we use game theory concepts to formally model this problem as a game, in which the players are the users and the pay-off function is a combination of the benefits and costs of the information-sharing process. We introduce a novel theoretical framework called Online Information-Sharing Assistance (OISA) to evaluate the interactive nature of the information-sharing trade-off problem. Using these theoretical foundations, we develop a set of AI agents that attempt to calculate a strategy for balancing this trade-off. Finally, as a proof of concept, we conduct an empirical study in a simulated Facebook environment in which human participants compete against OISA-based AI agents, showing that significantly higher utility can be achieved using OISA.",MDPI,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info13040183,,,,

Data regarding the social, behavioral, clinical, and structural factors that facilitate or impede viral suppression among HIV-seropositive women is needed. This study aims to examine HIV-seropositive women's perceptions regarding factors that contribute to their HIV treatment decisions. Two case studies describe the HIV treatment decision-making of two never suppressed, HIV-seropositive women aged 65 and 54. The framework method of analysis was employed to obtain a descriptive overview of three interrelated areas of inquiry: (1) the meanings women give to VS; (2) social, behavioral, clinical, and structural obstacles related to HIV medication adherence; and (3) women's perceptions of what they need to achieve and sustain (VS). The meaning of VS for both women is influenced by how they currently feel. Women's general feeling of wellness detracts from any sense of urgency that may be associated with engaging in HIV treatment. Mistrust of medical providers and unstable housing/unemployment pose as obstacles to medication adherence. Finally, women's accounts of what they need to achieve and remain virally suppressed are influenced by a gap in understanding related to HIV treatment. HIV clinicians should routinely measure their patients' HIV health literacy to ensure patients understand when to begin and why they should continue an HIV treatment regimen.

The importance of multimedia teaching technology in piano instruction has started to emerge in our country and society due to the ongoing development of this kind of technology in music educational institutions here. The conventional method of teaching piano has several drawbacks that may be mitigated by using one of the several alternative methods of instruction for the instrument, especially in light of the ongoing advancements in science and technology. A pianist's methods of expression are the tools they use to convey their thoughts and emotions about a piece of music to the audience. Teachers may demonstrate their musical skills to students and they must immediately focus on a musical expression which is vital for performers. In this paper, the Multimedia-based Piano Teaching Model (MPTM) has been proposed to improve the piano teaching quality. Traditional piano instruction is improved and developed using multimedia technology in this article. The Internet education model is used for teacher assessment, and the systematic way representing piano teaching combines different music educational materials. It begins building a sufficiently broad music network infrastructure resource sharing framework and benefits society's amateur music literacy. The use of machine learning in students' concrete piano instruction has the potential to thoroughly promote contemporary piano instruction and enhance the overall quality of instruction. To begin, an explanation of the intelligent piano's features and capabilities is provided. The neural network is used to suggest a technique for detecting a piano note on a set. The network can assess the input piano music signal's time frequency by translating the original time-domain waveform into the time-varying frequency distribution. Intelligent piano instruction analysis can effectively achieve the overall optimization of piano performance. The test results show that MPTM has a significant role in boosting the desire to learn to play the instrument. The experimental results show that the proposed MPTM achieves a learning skills ratio of 97.6%, a learning activity ratio of 98.5%, a student performance ratio of 93.8%, a teaching evaluation ratio of 90.3%, and a learning behavior ratio of 94.2% when compared to other methods.",WILEY,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/7266492,,,,

One of the frameworks for SDG 4 is to propose the concepts of equitable quality education. To attain and work in the context of SDG 4, artificial intelligence (AI) is a booming technology, which is gaining interest in understanding student behavior and assessing student performance. AI holds great potential for improving education as it has started to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches in education to create better learning. To provide better education, data analytics is critical. AI and machine learning approaches provide rapid solutions with high accuracy. This paper presents an AI-based analytics tool created to predict student performance in a first-year Information Technology literacy course at The University of the South Pacific (USP). A Random Forest based classification model was developed which predicted the performance of the student in week 6 with an accuracy value of 97.03%, sensitivity value of 95.26%, specificity value of 98.8%, precision value of 98.86%, Matthews correlation coefficient value of 94% and Area Under the ROC Curve value of 99%. Hence, such a method is very useful in predicting student performance early in their courses of allowing for early intervention. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested prediction model satisfies the required accuracy, precision, and recall factors for forecasting the behavioural elements of teaching and e-learning for students in virtual education systems.",MDPI,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14042377,,,,

The magnitude of losses due to floods has prompted researchers to focus more on robust and comprehensive modeling approaches for alleviating flood damages. Recently developed multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are being widely used to construct decision-making process more participatory, rational, and efficient. In this study, two statistical MCDM approaches, namely the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), have been employed to generate flood risk maps together with hazard and vulnerability maps in a GIS framework for Navsari city in Gujarat, India, to identify the vulnerable areas that are more susceptible to inundation during floods. The study area was divided into 10 sub areas (i.e., NC1 to NC10) to appraise the degree of flood hazard, vulnerability and risk intensities in terms of areal coverage and categorized under 5 intensity classes, viz., very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. A total of 14 flood indicators, seven each for hazard (i.e., elevation, slope, drainage density, distance to river, rainfall, soil, and flow accumulation) and vulnerability (i.e., population density, female population, land use, road network density, household, distance to hospital, and literacy rate) were considered for evaluating the flood risk. Flood risk coverage evaluated from the two approaches were compared with the flood extent computed from the actual flood data collected at 36 random locations. Results revealed that the TOPSIS approach estimated more precise flood risk coverage than the AHP approach, yielding high R-2 values, i.e., 0.78 to 0.95 and low RMSE values, i.e., 0.95 to 0.43, for all the 5 risk intensity classes. The sub areas identified under very high and high risk intensity classes (i.e., NC1, NC4, NC6, NC7, NC8, and NC10) call for immediate flood control measures with a view to palliate the extent of flood risk and consequential damages. The study demonstrates the potential of AHP and TOPSIS integrated with GIS towards precise identification of flood-prone areas for devising effective flood management strategies.",SPRINGER,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10111-x,,,,

Despite its popularity, little is known about the roles and effects of algorithmic literacy (AL) on user acceptance. The purpose of this study is to contextualize AL in the AI environment by empirically examining the role of AL in developing users' information processing in algorithms. The authors analyze how users engage with over-the-top (OTT) platforms, what awareness the user has of the algorithmic platform and how awareness of AL may impact their interaction with these systems. Design/methodology/approach This study employed multiple-group equivalence methods to compare two group invariance and the hypotheses concerning differences in the effects of AL. The method examined how AL helps users to envisage, understand and work with algorithms, depending on their understanding of the control of the information flow embedded within them. Findings Our findings clarify what functions AL plays in the adoption of OTT platforms and how users experience algorithms, particularly in contexts where AI is used in OTT algorithms to provide personalized recommendations. The results point to the heuristic functions of AL in connection with its ties in trust and ensuing attitude and behavior. Heuristic processes using AL strongly affect the credibility of recommendations and the way users understand the accuracy and personalization of results. The authors argue that critical assessment of AL must be understood not just about how it is used to evaluate the trust of service, but also regarding how it is performatively related in the modeling of algorithmic personalization. Research limitations/implications The relation of AL and trust in an algorithm lends strategic direction in developing user-centered algorithms in OTT contexts. As the AI industry has faced decreasing credibility, the role of user trust will surely give insights on credibility and trust in algorithms. To better understand how to cultivate a sense of literacy regarding algorithm consumption, the AI industry could provide examples of what positive engagement with algorithm platforms looks like. Originality/value User cognitive processes of AL provide conceptual frameworks for algorithm services and a practical guideline for the design of OTT services. Framing the cognitive process of AL in reference to trust has made relevant contributions to the ongoing debate surrounding algorithms and literacy. While the topic of AL is widely recognized, empirical evidence on the effects of AL is relatively rare, particularly from the user's behavioral perspective. No formal theoretical model of algorithmic decision-making based on the dual processing model has been researched.",EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/INTR-02-2021-0087,,,,

There is little research from an organizational perspective about how technology can help create a sustainable aging workforce. Objective: This study aims to (1) explore how technological solutions in organizations can help create and maintain a healthy, productive, and capable aging workforce; and (2) provide recommendations and strategic guidance that benefit both the aging worker and the organization. Methods: International standardization practices, ethical frameworks, collaborative research, and use cases are used to demonstrate how technological solutions can be translated into practice and formed the basis for the development of a set of recommendations to create and maintain a sustainable aging workforce. Results: Organizations need to look at aging through different lenses to optimize an age-inclusive workforce rather than viewing it by chronological age alone. International standards in technology, human resources management, and aging societies can form part of the solution to improve aging workforces. Digitalization of workplaces, digital literacy, innovation, intergenerational collaboration, and knowledge management form important elements of the international standard on age-inclusive workforce. Using internationally agreed ethical frameworks that consider age bias when designing artificial intelligence-related products and services can help organizations in their approach. Age bias in artificial intelligence development in the workplace can be avoided through inclusive practices. No blockchain application was found yet to improve the aging workforce. Barriers to blockchain adoption include fear of layoffs, worker resistance and lack of blockchain competence, worldwide adoption, support, and funding. Integrating blockchain into the internet of things may allow for improved efficiencies, reduce cost, and resolve workforce capacity problems. Organizations could benefit from implementing or funding wearable technologies for their workers. Recent tools such as the Ageing@Work toolkit consisting of virtual user models and virtual workplace models allow for the adaptation of the work processes and the ergonomics of workplaces to the evolving needs of aging workers. Lastly, selected use cases that may contribute to sustaining an aging workforce are explored (eg, the Exposure-Documentation-System, wireless biomedical sensors, and digital voice notes). Conclusions: The synergy of international standardization and ethical framework tools with research can advance information and communication technology solutions in improving aging workforces. There appears to be a momentum that technological solutions to achieve an age-inclusive workforce will undoubtedly find a stronger place within the global context and is most likely to have increased acceptance of technological applications among aging workers as well as organizations and governments. International standardization, cross-country research, and learning from use cases play an important role to ensure practical, efficient, and ethical implementation of technological solutions to contribute to a sustainable aging workforce.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/27250,,,,

Each framing offers valuable, but different insights into what computational thinking can and should be. The differences between the three framings also concern the views of learning that they embody. We combine the three framings into one framework which emphasizes that (1) computational thinking activities involve engagement with algorithmic processes, and (2) the mere use of a digital artifact for an activity is not sufficient to count as computational thinking. We further present a set of approaches to learning computational thinking.

Adjacent to seven newly established fisheries comanagement areas initiated in 2018, we examine the attributes of fishing households that influence perceived food, finance and job security, and compliance with fishing closures. We interviewed respondents from 1828 fishing households in 2019 and 2025 households in 2021 across the seven areas in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. A key finding was that perceived food, financial and job security outcomes increased over the two-year period and were positively related to respondents knowledge of fisheries comanagement. Relationships between both household savings and loans and with household food security highlights the need for policy and institutional support for fishing households in times of need. Household income from fisheries and trust in community leaders was also related to higher reported compliance with fishing closures, suggesting that income security and community leadership are important drivers of adoption of comanagement resource harvest rules. In contrast, women who identified as fish processors reported that they did not comply with fishing closures, as likely they were not involved in management decision making. Moreover, the positive impact of respondent's trust in their community, on food, financial and job security, implies that strong community relationships can benefit well-being of coastal communities.

Objective: To determine the relationship between SES and asthma morbidity among AA/B and H/L adults with moderate to severe asthma using multidomain SES frameworks and mediation analyses. Methods: We analyzed enrollment data from the PeRson EmPowered Asthma RElief randomized trial, evaluating inhaled corticosteroid supplementation to rescue therapy. We tested for direct and indirect relationships between SES and asthma morbidity using structural equation models. For SES, we used a latent variable defined by poverty, education, and unemployment. For asthma morbidity, we used self-reported asthma exacerbations in the year before enrollment (corticosteroid bursts, emergency room/urgent care visits, or hospitalizations), and Asthma Control Test scores. We tested for mediation via health literacy, perceived stress, and self-reported discrimination. All models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, and comorbidities. Results: Among 990 AA/B and H/L adults, low SES (latent variable) was directly associated with hospitalizations (beta = 0.24) and worse Asthma Control Test scores (beta = 0.20). Stress partially mediated the relationship between SES and increased emergency room/urgent care visits and worse asthma control (beta = 0.03 and = 0.05, respectively).

The conclusions reveal that it is key to make teachers aware of the paradigm shift, with a teaching that includes as digital competencies: knowing how to create and manipulate data, knowing how to use programs and information systems, knowing how to socialize and collaborate in digital environments, knowing how to exercise and respect a digital citizenship, knowing how to manage knowledge assertively, and, as we propose in this paper, knowing how to be a researcher in a digital environment.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.1004967,,,,

These efforts revealed a significant need to prepare youth to gain a fundamental understanding of how intelligence is created, applied, and its potential to perpetuate bias and unfairness. This study contributes to the growing interest in K-12 AI education by examining student learning of modelling real-world text data. Four students from an Advanced Placement computer science classroom at a public high school participated in this study. Our qualitative analysis reveals that the students developed nuanced and in-depth understandings of how text classification models-a type of AI application-are trained. Specifically, we found that in modelling texts, students: (1) drew on their social experiences and cultural knowledge to create predictive features, (2) engineered predictive features to address model errors, (3) described model learning patterns from training data and (4) reasoned about noisy features when comparing models. This study contributes to an initial understanding of student learning of modelling unstructured data and offers implications for scaffolding in-depth reasoning about model decision making. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Scholarly attention has turned to examining Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy in K-12 to help students understand the working mechanism of AI technologies and critically evaluate automated decisions made by computer models. While efforts have been made to engage students in understanding AI through building machine learning models with data, few of them go in-depth into teaching and learning of feature engineering, a critical concept in modelling data. There is a need for research to examine students' data modelling processes, particularly in the little-researched realm of unstructured data. What this paper adds Results show that students developed nuanced understandings of models learning patterns in data for automated decision making. Results demonstrate that students drew on prior experience and knowledge in creating features from unstructured data in the learning task of building text classification models. Students needed support in performing feature engineering practices, reasoning about noisy features and exploring features in rich social contexts that the data set is situated in. Implications for practice and/or policy It is important for schools to provide hands-on model building experiences for students to understand and evaluate automated decisions from AI technologies. Students should be empowered to draw on their cultural and social backgrounds as they create models and evaluate data sources. To extend this work, educators should consider opportunities to integrate AI learning in other disciplinary subjects (ie, outside of computer science classes).",WILEY,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13253,,,,

In particular, GAI's impact on higher education has the potential to change students' learning experience as well as faculty's teaching. However, concerns have been raised about ethical consideration and decreased reliability of the existing examinations. Furthermore, in medical education, curriculum reform is required to adapt to the revolutionary changes brought about by the integration of GAI into medical practice and research. Objective: This study analyzes the impact of GAI on medical education curricula and explores strategies for adaptation. Methods: The study was conducted in the context of faculty development at a medical school in Japan. A workshop involving faculty and students was organized, and participants were divided into groups to address two research questions: (1) How does GAI affect undergraduate medical education curricula? and (2) How should medical school curricula be reformed to address the impact of GAI? The strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) framework was used, and cross-SWOT matrix analysis was used to devise strategies. Further, 4 researchers conducted content analysis on the data generated during the workshop discussions. Results: The data were collected from 8 groups comprising 55 participants. Further, 5 themes about the impact of GAI on medical education curricula emerged: improvement of teaching and learning, improved access to information, inhibition of existing learning processes, problems in GAI, and changes in physicians' professionality. Positive impacts included enhanced teaching and learning efficiency and improved access to information, whereas negative impacts included concerns about reduced independent thinking and the adaptability of existing assessment methods. Further, GAI was perceived to change the nature of physicians' expertise. Three themes emerged from the cross-SWOT analysis for curriculum reform: (1) learning about GAI, (2) learning with GAI, and (3) learning aside from GAI. Participants recommended incorporating GAI literacy, ethical considerations, and compliance into the curriculum. Learning with GAI involved improving learning efficiency, supporting information gathering and dissemination, and facilitating patient involvement. Learning aside from GAI emphasized maintaining GAI-free learning processes, fostering higher cognitive domains of learning, and introducing more communication exercises. Conclusions: This study highlights the profound impact of GAI on medical education curricula and provides insights into curriculum reform strategies. Participants recognized the need for GAI literacy, ethical education, and adaptive learning. Further, GAI was recognized as a tool that can enhance efficiency and involve patients in education. The study also suggests that medical education should focus on competencies that GAI hardly replaces, such as clinical experience and communication. Notably, involving both faculty and students in curriculum reform discussions fosters a sense of ownership and ensures broader perspectives are encompassed.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/53466,,,,

However, modeling affect dynamics is challenging due to contextual factors, such as the complex and nuanced nature of intra- and inter- personal dependencies. Intrapersonal dependencies refer to the influences and dynamics within an individual, including their affective states and how it evolves over time. Interpersonal dependencies, on the other hand, involve the interactions and dynamics between individuals, encompassing how affective displays are influenced by and influence others during conversations. To address these challenges, we propose a Cross-person Memory Transformer (CPM-T) framework which explicitly models intra- and inter- personal dependencies in multi-modal non-verbal cues. The CPM-T framework maintains memory modules to store and update dependencies between earlier and later parts of a conversation. Additionally, our framework employs cross-modal attention to effectively align information from multi-modalities and leverage cross-person attention to align behaviors in multi-party interactions. We evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach on three publicly available datasets for joint engagement, rapport, and human belief prediction tasks.

In the K-12 (school) context, a consensus has emerged over time on the paradigmatic elements of computing education, which implicitly assumes a von Neumann computer executing instruction sequences guided by imperative programs [1, 3]. Within this framework, many researchers have focused on how to facilitate learners to develop an accurate mental model of what the computer does when it executes a piece of code. However, the traditional programming approach in computing education is inadequate for understanding and developing machine learning (ML) driven technology. ML has already facilitated significant advancements in automation, ranging from speech and image recognition, autonomous cars, and deepfake videos to super-human performance in board and computer games, and more. Many datadriven approaches that power today's cutting edge services and apps significantly diverge from the central paradigmatic assumptions of traditional programming [3]. Consequently, traditional views on computing education are increasingly being challenged to account for the changes that AI/ML brings [2]. This keynote talk presents early results from a study on how to teach fundamental AI insights and techniques to 200 4-9 graders in 14 primary schools in Eastern Finland. It describes the learning environments, tools, and pedagogical approaches involved, and explores the paradigmatic and conceptual changes required in transitioning from teaching classical programming to teaching ML in K-12 computing education [4]. It outlines the mindset shifts required for this transition and discusses the challenges posed to the development of curricula, educational technology, and learning environments. It further provides examples of how AI ethics concepts, such as algorithmic bias, privacy, misinformation, diversity, and accountability, can be integrated into ML education. The talk discusses the relationship between different literacies in computing and presents an active concept, data agency, that refers to people's volition and capacity for informed actions that make a difference in their digital world. It emphasizes not only the understanding of data (i.e., data literacy) but also the active control and manipulation of information flows and the ethical and wise use of them [5].",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3587102.3593796,,,,

After conducting a survey and interviews, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the expected findings and uncover meaningful insights regarding the utilization, preferences, and challenges within the ride-sharing industry in Bangladesh. The findings of this study reveal that cultural factors, such as the preference for bargaining and personal connections, strongly influence the popularity of contractual rides. Additionally, concerns related to safety, data privacy, and trust act as barriers to ride-sharing app adoption. Being associated with UN SDG Goals 11 and 9, the implications of this research extend beyond Bangladesh and can provide insights for policymakers, transportation companies, and technology developers seeking to understand the factors shaping the adoption of ride-sharing apps in similar contexts.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3588001.3609361,,,,

The current narrative is that we need to embed the LLM-based tools into the system taking advantage of their personalised, dynamic, adaptive nature while being mindful of their limitations. One of the greatest limitations so far identified is that these pre-trained transformer-based encoder models fine-tuned on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks do not reveal verifiable reasoning ability. As a result, the information generated by these tools is subject to ethical and factual errors that need human oversight. This paper uses the integrative literature review to identify and synthesize Critical Digital Literacy frameworks in language teaching in the light of the essential competencies and learning domains identified by the UNESCO Education for Sustainable Development directives. The Critical AI Literacy framework proposed in this paper would enable language teachers to adopt LLM-based tools to enhance their instructional strategies. The cognitive, affective and conative competencies developed through the new CAIL framework would empower learners to understand the manipulative nature of language and use language to build a sustainable future.",AESTHETICS MEDIA SERVICES-AESTHETIXMS,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.21659/rupkatha.v15n4.13,,,,

Education systems now need to train students at the K-12 level to live in a society where they must interact with AI. Thus, AI literacy is a pedagogical and cognitive challenge at the K-12 level. This study aimed to understand how AI is being integrated into K-12 education worldwide. We conducted a search process following the systematic literature review method using Scopus. 179 documents were reviewed, and two broad groups of AI literacy approaches were identified, namely learning experience and theoretical perspective. The first group covered experiences in learning technical, conceptual and applied skills in a particular domain of interest. The second group revealed that significant efforts are being made to design models that frame AI literacy proposals. There were hardly any experiences that assessed whether students understood AI concepts after the learning experience. Little attention has been paid to the undesirable consequences of an indiscriminate and insufficiently thought-out application of AI. A competency framework is required to guide the didactic proposals designed by educational institutions and define a curriculum reflecting the sequence and academic continuity, which should be modular, personalized and adjusted to the conditions of the schools. Finally, AI literacy can be leveraged to enhance the learning of disciplinary core subjects by integrating AI into the teaching process of those subjects, provided the curriculum is co-designed with teachers.",SPRINGER,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40594-023-00418-7,,,,

However, accurate comparisons of their relative effectiveness are challenging, partly due to a lack of clarity and detail regarding the intervention content being evaluated. This study summarizes intervention components and characteristics in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to T2DM using a taxonomy for SMIs as a framework and identifies components that are insufficiently incorporated into the design of the intervention or insufficiently reported. Following evidence mapping methodology, we searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane, and PsycINFO from 2010 to 2018 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on SMIs for T2DM. We used the terms 'self-management', 'adult' and 'T2DM' for content. For data extraction, we used an online platform based on the taxonomy for SMIs. Two independent reviewers assessed eligible references; one reviewer extracted data, and a second checked accuracy. We identified 665 RCTs for SMIs (34% US, 21% Europe) including 164,437 (median 123, range 10-14,559) adults with T2DM. SMIs highly differed in design and content, and characteristics such as mode of delivery, intensity, location and providers involved were poorly described. The majority of interventions aimed to improve clinical outcomes like HbA1c (83%), weight (53%), lipid profile (45%) or blood pressure (42%); 27% (also) targeted quality of life. Improved knowledge, health literacy, patient activation or satisfaction with care were hardly used as outcomes (<16%). SMIs most often used education (98%), self-monitoring (56%), goal-setting (48%) and skills training (42%) to improve outcomes. Management of emotions (17%) and shared decision-making (5%) were almost never mentioned. Although diabetes is highly prevalent in some minority groups, in only 13% of the SMIs, these groups were included. Our findings highlight the large heterogeneity that exists in the design of SMIs for T2DM and the way studies are reported, making accurate comparisons of their relative effectiveness challenging. In addition, SMIs pay limited attention to outcomes other than clinical, despite the importance attached to these outcomes by patients.

However, its diverse manifestations across various contexts underscore the urgent need to integrate and amalgamate these facets within pedagogical frameworks that prioritize students' erudition. This research undertakes a comprehensive analysis of multifarious technological modalities and puts forth a harmonized model that could furnish a foundational structure for classroom instruction. Central to this paradigm is the recognition of the paramountcy of intelligent tutoring systems, which serve to democratize access to tutoring. By imbuing these systems with advanced AI capabilities, learners can benefit from personalized and adaptive support, irrespective of their location or socioeconomic background. Furthermore, the significance of conducting technological experiments cannot be understated, as it allows for the exploration of new frontiers and the subsequent application of findings to teaching-learning models.

Aim The study holistically explored factors contributing towards the unsafe use of opioids and identifies strategies to overcome them. Method Exploratory qualitative methods using interviews, focus groups and non-participant observational case studies were used. Interviews and focus groups were carried out face-to-face as well as virtually and observations were conducted in community pharmacies in Islamabad and Khyber Pukhtoon Khuwa province, Pakistan. Data were collected from 4 stakeholder groups; pharmacy policy makers (n = 11), people with chronic non-malignant pain (n = 14), doctors (n = 31) and community pharmacists (n = 36) by purposive critical case sampling method. Data were analysed inductively using reflexive thematic analysis and then deductively mapped to a social ecological framework. Non-participant observations were analysed using a cross case synthesis using explanation building technique. Data from all three methods were triangulated to develop a logic model. Results Identified factors at macro (regulation), meso (social perceptions of pain and opioids) and micro levels (uncontrolled pain, self-medication, health literacy) and strategies are presented holistically and were used to develop a logic model for the prevention and mitigation of factors currently causing unsafe use of opioids.

On the one hand, the impact of AI in the field of education is addressed from the perspective of the Sustainable Development Goals (specifically, SDG4) of the UNESCO 2030 Agenda, describing the opportunities for its use by teachers and students. On the other hand, there is an emphasis on the uncertainties caused by the fears of some who think, for example, that AI robots will replace human teachers. The methodology used is based on a documentary review, supported by reports and studies conducted by researchers as well as institutions and organizations committed to the development of AI and its capacity for action in the educational field, and the ethical questions that experts and organizations around the world are raising. The results seek to influence and deepen the ethical implications that AI can have in the educational field. Finally, some critical questions about the ethics and challenges of AI in education are proposed, concluding with the need to add proposals with new research and political actions which could lead to the creation of an ethical observatory of AI for education.",Oxbridge Publishing House,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3916/C74-2023-03,,,,

In this background, cardio-oncology rehabilitation frameworks for specific cancer patients have been proposed. How-ever, optimal program designs, as well as their overall safety and efficacy in different subsets of patients, are not fully ascertained.Design: Single-center, pragmatic, prospective, randomized controlled trial performed in Portugal aiming to evaluate the impact of a center-based cardiac rehabilitation program, consisting of exercise training, nutritional counselling, psychosocial management and lifestyle behavior change, compared to community-based exercise training, in cancer survivors.Methods: Adult cancer survivors (N = 80) exposed to cardiotoxic cancer treatment and/or with previous car-diovascular disease will be randomized (1:1) to receive either an eight-week cardiac rehabilitation program or community-based exercise training. Primary endpoint is cardiorespiratory fitness; secondary endpoints are physical activity, psychosocial parameters, blood pressure, body composition, lipids and inflammatory param-eters. Physical function, quality of life, fatigue, health literacy, and feasibility will be assessed; a cost-effectiveness evaluation will also be performed. Between-group differences at baseline and in the change from baseline to the end of the study will be tested with unpaired t -tests or Mann-Whitney U test.

The influx of migrants, who make up a substantial portion of China's population and continue to rapidly expand, has seriously hampered CD prevention and control, needing special care. This study aimed to identify key factors influencing the utilization of CD prevention and treatment education (CDPTE) among the floating population. We are confident that the findings will highlight obstacles facing CDPTE among the migrants, and guide future development prevention, treatment of CD, and health education services.MethodsA sample of migrants aged 15 years and above in 32 provincial units nationwide in 2018 was recruited by stratified multi-stage proportional to population size sampling (PPS). A structured questionnaire survey was conducted via face-to-face interviews. Subsequently, the Anderson health service utilization model was used as the theoretical framework and SPSS 26.0 statistical software was applied to analyze the data. The statistical description of the current situation of CDPTE acceptance and the chi-square test were used to compare the differences in CDPTE acceptance by different characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze key factors affecting the use of CDPTE among migrants.ResultsA total of 40.1% of the recruited participants reported receiving education on CD prevention and treatment, primarily delivered through traditional transmission media. Multilevel logistic regression results revealed that male migrants, aged 30-49 years, unmarried, with higher educational attainment, an average monthly household income of CNY 7,500-9,999 (or US$1,176-1,568), working more than 40 h per week, flowing into the Central and Western regions, migrated in the province, self-rated health, contracted family doctors and those with health records were more likely to receive CDPTE (p < 0.05).ConclusionOur findings revealed unsatisfactory acceptance of education on CD prevention and treatment among migrants, implying that health education should be strengthened further. Publicity of relevant policies and works should be strengthened and specific interventions should be developed for key regions as well as vulnerable groups to enhance CDPTE. More financial support should also be provided to improve the quality of health education.",BMC,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-15126-8,,,,

The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by an unprecedented global infodemic that has led to confusion about the benefits of medical and public health interventions, with substantial impact on risk-taking and health-seeking behaviors, eroding trust in health authorities and compromising the effectiveness of public health responses and policies. Standardized measures are needed to quantify the harmful impacts of the infodemic in a systematic and methodologically robust manner, as well as harmonizing highly divergent approaches currently explored for this purpose. This can serve as a foundation for a systematic, evidence-based approach to monitoring, identifying, and mitigating future infodemic harms in emergency preparedness and prevention. Objective: In this paper, we summarize the Fifth World Health Organization (WHO) Infodemic Management Conference structure, proceedings, outcomes, and proposed actions seeking to identify the interdisciplinary approaches and frameworks needed to enable the measurement of the burden of infodemics. Methods: An iterative human-centered design (HCD) approach and concept mapping were used to facilitate focused discussions and allow for the generation of actionable outcomes and recommendations. The discussions included 86 participants representing diverse scientific disciplines and health authorities from 28 countries across all WHO regions, along with observers from civil society and global public health-implementing partners. A thematic map capturing the concepts matching the key contributing factors to the public health burden of infodemics was used throughout the conference to frame and contextualize discussions. Five key areas for immediate action were identified. Results: The 5 key areas for the development of metrics to assess the burden of infodemics and associated interventions included (1) developing standardized definitions and ensuring the adoption thereof; (2) improving the map of concepts influencing the burden of infodemics; (3) conducting a review of evidence, tools, and data sources; (4) setting up a technical working group; and (5) addressing immediate priorities for postpandemic recovery and resilience building. The summary report consolidated group input toward a common vocabulary with standardized terms, concepts, study designs, measures, and tools to estimate the burden of infodemics and the effectiveness of infodemic management interventions. Conclusions: Standardizing measurement is the basis for documenting the burden of infodemics on health systems and population health during emergencies. Investment is needed into the development of practical, affordable, evidence-based, and systematic methods that are legally and ethically balanced for monitoring infodemics; generating diagnostics, infodemic insights, and recommendations; and developing interventions, action-oriented guidance, policies, support options, mechanisms, and tools for infodemic managers and emergency program managers.

Quantifying its risk to food security, livelihoods, and sustainability is crucial. This study proposes a framework to estimate the impact climate stress on agriculture in terms of three objectives: assessing the regional vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity), analysing the climate variability, and measuring agricultural performance under climatic stress. The vulnerability of twenty-two sub-regions in Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh is assessed using indicators to determine the collective susceptibility of the agricultural framework to climate change. An index-based approach with min-max normalization is employed, ranking the districts based on their relative performances across vulnerability indicators. This work assesses the impact of socio-economic and climatic indicators on the performance of agricultural growth using the benchmark Ricardian approach. The parameters of the agricultural growth function are estimated using a linear combination of socio-economic and exposure variables. Lastly, the forecasted trends of climatic variables are examined using a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural network, providing an annual estimate of climate variability. The results indicate a negative impact of annual minimum temperature and decreasing land holdings on agricultural GDP, while cropping intensity, rural literacy, and credit facilities have positive effects. Budgam, Ganderbal, and Bandipora districts exhibit higher vulnerability due to factors such as low literacy rates, high population density, and extensive rice cultivation. Conversely, Kargil, Rajouri, and Poonch districts show lower vulnerability due to the low population density and lower level of institutional development. We observe an increasing trend of minimum temperature across the region. The proposed LSTM synthesizes a predictive estimate across five essential climate variables with an average overall root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.91, outperforming the benchmark ARIMA and exponential-smoothing models by 32-48%. These findings can guide policymakers and stakeholders in developing strategies to mitigate climate stress on agriculture and enhance resilience.",MDPI,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su151411465,,,,

Critical thinking is a learned skill that needs instruction and practice. Computer programs are shared and can demonstrate a concept via sound, attractive animation, and demo. It permits learners to progress at their work and pace independently or to problem-solve in a group. Computers deliver instant feedback, allowing students to know whether their response is right or not. Hence, in this paper, a Machine learning Framework (MLF) has been suggested to assess and monitor computer-aided reading classes for improving student critical thinking skills. To understand a text, the student needs to diagnose its words and access its meaning. Multi-task learning (MTL) has been used in the proposed model for topic tagging questions to enhance the documents sample size. To alleviate the influence of inappropriate word segmentation and consecutive mine information of entire sentences, word depictions and bidirectional gated recurrent unit networks are assumed in our method.

Current dietary self-monitoring tools focus primarily on itemizing foods and counting calories, which can be complex, time-intensive, and dependent on health literacy. Further, there are no dietary self-monitoring tools that conform to the plate-based approach of the 2019 Canada Food Guide (CFG), wherein the recommended proportions of three food groups are visually represented on a plate without specifying daily servings or portion sizes. This paper explored the perceptions of end-users (i.e., general public) and Registered Dietitians of iCANPlateTM-a dietary self-monitoring mobile application resembling the CFG. Qualitative data were collected through virtual focus groups. Focus group questions were based on the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) theoretical framework to explore perceptions of using the CFG and currently available dietary self-monitoring tools.

Seven focus groups were conducted with Registered Dietitians (n = 44) and nine focus groups with members from the general public (n = 52). During the focus groups, participants mainly discussed the capabilities and opportunities required to use the current iteration of iCANPlateTM. Participants liked the simplicity of the application and its capacity to foster self-awareness of dietary behaviours rather than weight control or calorie counting. However, concerns were raised regarding iCANPlateTM's potential to improve adherence to dietary self-monitoring due to specific characteristics (i.e., insufficient classifications, difficulty in conceptualizing proportions, and lack of inclusivity). Overall, participants liked the simplicity of iCANPlateTM and its ability to promote self-awareness of dietary intakes, primarily through visual representation of foods on a plate as opposed to reliance on numerical values or serving sizes, were benefits of using the app. Findings from this study will be used to further develop the app with the goal of increasing adherence to plate-based dietary approaches.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294652,,,,

The target construct itself, reading proficiency, as often operationalized as an endpoint of formal secondary schooling, is defined and measured in imprecise, fragmented terms. Consequently, schools (and empirical research) fall back on heuristics like the Simple View of Reading, or a few stages (learn to read, read to learn, read to do) to describe reading development. Those models, however, are too general to guide instructional decisions for adaptive learning systems. Progress in engineering an adequate learning system has been inhibited by a mismatch with curriculum standards and school organization that impose good-faith but not fully optimized developmental targets on the educational system.

The interdisciplinary nature of AI and the relevance of AI in various fields require that university instructors and course developers integrate AI topics into the classroom and create so-called domain-specific AI courses. In this paper, we introduce the AI Course Design Planning Framework as a course planning framework to structure the development of domain-specific AI courses at the university level. The tool evolves non-specific course planning frameworks to address the context of domain-specific AI education. Following a design-based research approach, we evaluated a first prototype of the tool with instructors in the field of AI education who are developing domain-specific courses in this area. The results of our evaluation indicate that the tool allows instructors to create domain-specific AI courses in an efficient and comprehensible way. In general, instructors rated the tool as useful and user-friendly and made recommendations to improve its usability. Future research will focus on testing the application of the tool for domain-specific AI course developments in different domain contexts and examine the influence of using the tool on AI course quality and learning outcomes.",MDPI,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/educsci13090954,,,,

Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use.

In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students' individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K-12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers.

Prompt engineering can be loosely described as a new emerging field where one attempts to develop particular methods, strategies, and frameworks with the main aim of organizing and structuring inputs in such a way that sophisticated AI systems can perform different tasks. These methods, techniques, and frameworks can be concepts like in-context learning, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Retrieval Augmented Generation, ReAct prompting, and Directional Stimulus Prompting. These approaches are mainly developed so users can communicate more effectively and accurately with AI language models and enable obtaining better outputs or responses tailored to queries or goals they set. As an extension and new contribution to the mentioned research field, this conceptual paper aims to introduce, propose, and theorize the notion of 'educational promptization'. This will be done by connecting prompting to a particular social scientific practice perspective, sociomateriality. The rationale for arguing, however, is related to a need to develop an alternative research perspective to those that already dominate the mentioned research field, a research stream this conceptual paper also aims to engage with. Educational promptization is suggested as there is a demand to develop a more student-centric media literacy, especially as students and teachers engage with AI language interpreters on a daily basis. This means that the proposed educational promptization can arguably be considered to be part of a future AI literacy. An essential component of it is that one has to encompass the relational and symmetrical engagement with AI models. This is perhaps required because students will most likely be challenged to master the knowledge and skills in designing prompts, while simultaneously being capable of critically and meaningfully assessing the output of the prompts they created. In other words, mastering the complex input-and-output engagements with an AI system will be essential in students' future learning processes.",IEEE,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICAPAI61893.2024.10541229,,,,

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential solutions to this gap. While existing AI models address certain aspects of EEG analysis, a fully automated system for routine EEG interpretation is required for effective epilepsy management and healthcare professionals' decision-making. This study aims to develop an AI-augmented model for automating EEG seizure tracking, thereby supporting a sustainable digital care pathway for epilepsy (DCPE). The goal is to improve patient monitoring, facilitate collaborative decision-making, ensure timely medication adherence, and promote patient compliance.Method The study proposes an AI-augmented framework using machine learning, focusing on quantitative analysis of EEG data to automate DCPE. A focus group discussion was conducted with healthcare professionals to find the problem of the current digital care pathway and assess the feasibility, usability, and sustainability of the AI-augmented system in the digital care pathway.Results The study found that a combination of random forest with principal component analysis and support vector machines with KBest feature selection achieved high accuracy rates of 96.52% and 95.28%, respectively. Additionally, the convolutional neural networks model outperformed other deep learning algorithms with an accuracy of 97.65%.

A conversation analysis,PSYCHIATRIA I PSYCHOLOGIA KLINICZNA-JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY,Article,suicide; Internet; artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; suicide prevention,"Introduction and objective: Suicide is a critical global health concern, prioritised by the World Health Organization. Chatbot-based tools using artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as potential aids in suicide prevention. This study explores the use of ChatGPT, an advanced AI language model, in handling conversations related to suicide. Materials and methods: Conversations were simulated using a basic ChatGPT account, mimicking interactions with individuals expressing suicidal thoughts. Topics included inquiries about suicide methods, seeking help, and supporting others in crisis. ChatGPT's responses were analysed for their supportive nature and guidance. The study also investigated the feasibility of circumventing ChatGPT's restrictions, known as jailbreaking. Results: ChatGPT responded to suicidal queries with outwardly warmth messages, encouraging users to seek professional help and providing information on helplines, mental health organisations, and finding qualified therapists. It prioritised empathy, active listening, and professional intervention. Notably, a simple jailbreaking technique allowed ChatGPT to provide specific information on drugs for potential misuse in suicidal scenarios, posing significant concerns. Conclusions: While ChatGPT shows promise in suicide prevention, this study underscores the importance of recognising its limitations, such as the lack of genuine empathy and contextual understanding in its responses. Risks include the potential to provide inappropriate or harmful information and the inability to accurately assess suicide risk. ChatGPT may serve as a valuable tool in suicide prevention efforts, but ethical frameworks and regulations are crucial for the safe development and deployment of AI tools in mental health care.",MEDICAL COMMUNICATIONS,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.15557/PiPK.2024.0036,,,,

High school students face a significant gap in cybersecurity knowledge, essential for safeguarding the digital environment. This educational deficit renders them vulnerable to cyber threats, compromising personal and school-wide digital security. The global shortage of cybersecurity professionals exacerbates the issue, threatening future defenses against cyberattacks. This paper introduces Cyber Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a concept adapted from finance, to evaluate the risk to digital assets. It outlines a model using basic math and probability to assess and mitigate risks to these cyber assets, which include data, vulnerability, and potential negative impacts like financial or reputational loss at the time of cyber incident. The approach equates cyber assets to financial terms-assets, liabilities, and capital-to demonstrate how additional countermeasures can reduce cyber asset value. The paper emphasizes the importance of consistent cybersecurity practices, akin to the effects of compound interest, and aims to demystify cybersecurity for students using financial literacy and mathematical concepts. The paper uses the proposed method to calculate cyber risks for the prominent cyber-attacks such as Phishing, DDoS, Data breach, Ransomware, and IoT Vulnerabilities in the context of school. It further explains the value of problem based learning and provides an authentic assessment framework to establish a practical learning of cybersecurity concepts for high school students. Finally, it advocates for the integration of security measures in internet use, covering authentication, authorization, encryption, firewall, secure connections, and systems' upgrade to reduce cyber risks. With the rise of online education, gaming, social media, and digitalization, cyber awareness is crucial for high school students. The criticality of internet security is making cyber knowledge an urgent educational priority. Due to growing demand of IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), the paper suggests future research about explaining cyber risks to high school students using machine learning, human behavior, and system anomalies.",IEEE,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893209,,,,

The purpose of this study is to examine the digital competences students need to develop in order to use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools for learning purposes. We conducted 34 semi-structured interviews with 17 secondary school teachers in an interval of half a year, and triangulated these self-report data with an analysis of actual learning activities. During the interviews, the participants reported the digital competences their students develop using GenAI tools, and the skills they should practice. The digital competences were analyzed based on the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens 2.2 (DigComp 2.2) [8] that includes five main areas: Information and data literacy; Communication and collaboration; Digital content creation; Safety; and Problem solving. Despite DigComp 2.2's comprehensiveness, its pre-GenAI era foundation necessitates updates to fully address competences needed for GenAI use. The study findings indicate that the utilization of GenAI tools requires proficiency in all DigComp 2.2 domains. Importantly, employing GenAI tools calls for the expansion regarding the ability to analyze the pros and cons of AI tools, and the user's ability to choose GenAI tools that are appropriate for a given task. The findings suggest refining the framework's explanation regarding prompt-writing skills and adding the skill of managing ongoing dialogue with GenAI tools.

However, the complexity of AI concepts poses significant barriers to learning for individuals without prior AI knowledge. While teaching through analogies is a well-recognized method to simplify complex information by connecting it to familiar concepts, adapting these analogies to match individual learner profiles remains a substantial challenge. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel method for personalizing educational analogies, enhancing the accessibility and engagement of AI concepts for a diverse audience. Our approach uses Large language models (LLMs) to dynamically tailor content to each learner's cognitive and cultural contexts, grounded in educational theories and practices. Utilizing a crowdsourced A/B testing framework through Prolific (N=60), this research contrasts conventional instructional methods with content incorporating LLM-enhanced personalized analogies. Data collection comprised pre- and post-tests, activity logs, and surveys featuring Likert-scale and open-ended questions. Quantitative analysis of key learning outcomes revealed significant improvements in comprehension and retention, evidenced by enhanced pre-and post-test scores (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) and motivation, as indicated by increased engagement in survey responses (p < 0.05). Qualitative analysis revealed a need for more examples and visual aids to complement analogies and a preference for balancing analogies with detailed technical content. This study demonstrates the potential of AI-generated analogies to make complex AI concepts more accessible and engaging. Future research should refine analogy generation, incorporate multimedia elements, and explore long-term and cross-cultural impacts to further enhance AI education.",ASIA PACIFIC SOC COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION - APSCE,2024,,,,,

During early formative years children develop crucial skills in understanding, interpreting, and critically analyzing written texts. Proficiency in reading comprehension not only enables students to extract meaning front diverse sources but also fosters cognitive abilities such as inference-making, prediction, and evaluation. Moreover, reading comprehension serves as a gateway to accessing a wealth of knowledge across various subjects. However, generating material for reading comprehension assessments at a large scale remains a challenging process. Stories used for reading comprehension often have a set of criteria that needs to be met in terms of structure and content to be able to fairly assess the abilities of the learner. Advancements in natural language processing have empowered AI models to craft narratives comparable to human-generated stories.

Ironically, there is not much work in advancing the ATM UI for Hindi that can render it usefully towards a design which is - simple, error correcting or feedback capable and user - centric for weak users such as rural, elderly, laborers and new users. This paper proposes a novel framework referred to as explainable UI or XUI in Hindi that aims to enhance UX in terms of interpretability and inclusion of weak users. We integrate two most related and frequently performed tasks given by Cash Withdrawal and Balance Check in the XUI. The proposed Hindi XUI is implemented using HTML, CSS and Java Script and evaluated based on four UI features denoting PIN Entry, Transaction Type, Account Type and Amount Entry operations. The XUI simulated by us using touchscreen computer is tested for 34 weak and strong users. We formulate Usability - Gain as novel performance index to competitively evaluate XUI and Old UI. The experimental analysis quantifies Usability for XUI as 0.96 which is close to the upper limit of 1. Likewise, usability computed for OUI is - 0.66 which is close to lower limit of - 1.

This research is motivated by the potential of LLMs to predict learning performance based on its inherent reasoning and computational capabilities. By using reading comprehension datasets from the ITS, AutoTutor, we evaluate the predictive capabilities of GPT-4 versus traditional machine learning methods in predicting learning performance through five-fold cross-validation techniques. Our findings show that the GPT-4 presents the competitive predictive abilities with traditional machine learning methods such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, Performance Factor Analysis, Sparse Factor Analysis Lite (SPARFA-Lite), tensor factorization and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).

Nevertheless, AI is already an integral part of our digital daily lives, as we navigate through social networks, use our GPS, or consult recommendations on e-commerce websites. Due to its pervasive influence across all sectors of our societies, AI is gradually becoming a pivotal subject in terms of regulation, societal direction, and legislation. As early as 2021, UNESCO published a report presenting avenues for ethical considerations in AI. In June 2023, the European Union also established a regulatory framework outlining requirements and obligations for AI usage. As a digital manifestation and given the new ways in which its use influences human thinking, interaction and decision-making and affects education, human, social and natural sciences, culture, and communication and information (UNESCO. General Conference, 41st, 2021), public libraries have a role to play in enabling residents within their communities to grasp this technology. Their role is all the more significant as AI generates concerns and distrust (Gillath et al., 2021) among populations when libraries also continue to enjoy a high level of trust and appreciation in most of their communities (Arlitsch & Newell, 2017). Understanding AI thus constitutes a new cornerstone for accessing the necessary information to advance sustainable development, as outlined in the Lyon Declaration (2014). Moreover, comprehension of AI aligns with the ethical concerns articulated by UNESCO in terms of explainability and transparency and aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. These goals include quality education (4), industry, innovation and infrastructure (9), reduced inequalities (10), sustainable cities and communities (11), as well as responsible consumption and production (12). The role of public libraries in advancing the goals of the 2030 Agenda is beyond dispute (IFLA, 2016), and various digital literacies are already integral to their actions. As AI is predominantly developed by global economic giants and permeates all of our practices, Shouldn't [libraries] be the bastions of information literacy and information privacy in an AI world? (Cox et al., 2018). Thus, to what extent can public libraries take on this subject to promote and offer relevant literacy? For this study, we will conduct a cross-analysis among three European countries-Spain, France, and Italy-to provide insights into the diverse ways in which AI influences professional practices. Through a literature review and semi-structured interviews, the objective is to delineate the challenges of Artificial Intelligence within the framework of the Agenda 2030 program.

Higher education is now a key area of economic growth for many countries and thus has also become a target for exploitation, evidenced by the growing numbers of essay mills and similar services, and even more recently by some of the generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. The UK has also seen a growth in student numbers, particularly at postgraduate and for international students. In computing for example, UK PGT student numbers have increased rapidly with the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency reporting 25,225 computing PGT students in 2019/2020 rising to 47,410 in 2021/22, with 69% of these students being classed as international. These students can find it challenging to adapt to education in the UK and can have differing levels of abilities including digital literacy. Alongside this growth, the variety/incidence of student academic misconduct (AM) has also been rising. Previous research has tended to focus on plagiarism but there is an increasing need to explore the implications arising from the widespread availability of essay mills and generative AI tools. This study aims to provide a greater understanding of AM from the perspective of the computing PGT student. Adopting a case study approach, computing PGT students (n=358) were surveyed at one UK university in Spring 2023 with a follow up focus group. The study employed two PG students as researchers and this enabled a more trusted and student-centered approach to the survey, focus group and analysis. Thematic analysis of the data from the survey (responses n=26) and focus group (n=7) show students believe AM affects academic standards and understand the reasons behind this. They believe the university is providing clear AM guidance, but have more mixed opinions on whether they think the AM process is appropriate/fair. The analysis demonstrates the need for a holistic and concerted effort between staff and students based around six main areas: assessment; educational provision; staff attitudes/support; student opportunity/motivation; student belonging/engagement; and student-friendly AM guidance/resources. Future work is building on these recommendations to create a framework and set of practical interventions to promote academic integrity, and address the current AM challenges.",IEEE,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578821,,,,

Monitoring devices that measure (vital) parameters hold promise for timely identification and treatment of exacerbations. Stakeholders' perspectives on the use of monitoring devices are of importance for the successful development and implementation of a device. Objective: This study aimed to explore the potential use and value of a wearable monitoring bracelet (MB) for patients with COPD at high risk for exacerbation. The perspectives of health care professionals as well as patients were examined, both immediately after hospitalization and over a longer period. Furthermore, potential facilitators and barriers to the use and implementation of an MB were explored. Methods: Data for this qualitative study were collected from January to April 2023. A total of 11 participants (eg, n=6 health care professionals [HCPs], 2 patients, and 3 additional patients) participated. In total, 2 semistructured focus groups were conducted via video calls; 1 with HCPs of various professional backgrounds and 1 with patients. In addition, 3 semistructured individual interviews were held with patients. The interviews and focus groups addressed attitudes, wishes, needs, as well as factors that could either support or impede the potential MB use. Data from interviews and focus groups were coded and analyzed according to the principles of the framework method. Results: HCPs and patients both predominantly emphasized the importance of an MB in terms of promptly identifying exacerbations by detecting deviations from normal (vital) parameters, and subsequently alerting users. According to HCPs, this is how an MB should support the self-management of patients. Most participants did not anticipate major differences in value and use of an MB between the short-term and the long-term periods after hospitalization. Facilitators of the potential use and implementation of an MB that participants highlighted were ease of use and some form of support for patients in using an MB and interpreting the data. HCPs as well as patients expressed concerns about potential costs as a barrier to use and implementation. Another barrier that HCPs mentioned, was the prerequisite of digital literacy for patients to be able to interpret and react to the data from an MB. Conclusions: HCPs and patients both recognize that an MB could be beneficial and valuable to patients with COPD at high risk for exacerbation, in the short as well as the long term. In particular, they perceived value in supporting self-management of patients with COPD. Stakeholders would be able to use the obtained insights in support of the effective implementation of MBs in COPD patient care, which can potentially improve health care and the overall well-being of patients with COPD.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/57108,,,,

Although enthusiasm for integrating LLMs into emergency medicine (EM) is growing, the existing literature is characterized by a disparate collection of individual studies, conceptual analyses, and preliminary implementations. Given these complexities and gaps in understanding, a cohesive framework is needed to comprehend the existing body of knowledge on the application of LLMs in Objective: Given the absence of a comprehensive framework for exploring the roles of LLMs in EM, this scoping review aims to systematically map the existing literature on LLMs' potential applications within EM and identify directions for future research. Addressing this gap will allow for informed advancements in the field. Methods: Using PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) criteria, we searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for papers published between January 2018 and August 2023 that discussed LLMs' use in EM. We excluded other forms of AI. A total of 1994 unique titles and abstracts were screened, and each full-text paper was independently reviewed by 2 authors. Data were abstracted independently, and 5 authors performed a collaborative quantitative and qualitative synthesis of the data. Results: A total of 43 papers were included. Studies were predominantly from 2022 to 2023 and conducted in the United States and China. We uncovered four major themes: (1) clinical decision-making and support was highlighted as a pivotal area, with LLMs playing a substantial role in enhancing patient care, notably through their application in real-time triage, allowing early recognition of patient urgency; (2) efficiency, workflow, and information management demonstrated the capacity of LLMs to significantly boost operational efficiency, particularly through the automation of patient record synthesis, which could reduce administrative burden and enhance patient-centric care; (3) risks, ethics, and transparency were identified as areas of concern, especially regarding the reliability of LLMs' outputs, and specific studies highlighted the challenges of ensuring unbiased decision-making amidst potentially flawed training data sets, stressing the importance of thorough validation and ethical oversight; and (4) education and communication possibilities included LLMs' capacity to enrich medical training, such as through using simulated patient interactions that enhance communication skills. Conclusions: LLMs have the potential to fundamentally transform EM, enhancing clinical decision-making, optimizing workflows, and improving patient outcomes. This review sets the stage for future advancements by identifying key research areas: prospective validation of LLM applications, establishing standards for responsible use, understanding provider and patient perceptions, and improving physicians' AI literacy. Effective integration of LLMs into EM will require collaborative efforts and thorough evaluation to ensure these technologies can be safely and effectively applied.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/53787,,,,

This systematic review aims to identify and quantify the types of AI errors to better understand the consequences of implementing this technology.Methods Electronic databases were searched for external validation studies of the accuracy of AI algorithms in real-world screening mammograms. Descriptive synthesis was performed on error types and frequency. False negative proportions (FNP) and false positive proportions (FPP) were pooled within AI positivity thresholds using random-effects meta-analysis.Results Seven retrospective studies (447,676 examinations; published 2019-2022) met inclusion criteria. Five studies reported AI error as false negatives or false positives. Pooled FPP decreased incrementally with increasing positivity threshold (71.83% [95% CI 69.67, 73.90] at Transpara 3 to 10.77% [95% CI 8.34, 13.79] at Transpara 9).

Heterogeneity within thresholds reflected algorithm version and completeness of the reference standard. Other forms of AI error were reported rarely (location error and technical error in one study each).Conclusion AI errors are largely interpreted in the framework of test accuracy. FP and FN errors show expected variability not only by positivity threshold, but also by algorithm version and study quality.

As a result, many AI investments have stalled at the prototype level, never reaching clinical settings. Objective: To improve the chances of future AI implementation projects succeeding, we analyzed the experiences of clinical AI system implementers to better understand the challenges and success factors in their implementations. Methods: Thirty-seven implementers of clinical AI from European and North and South American countries were interviewed. Semi -structured interviews were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively with the framework method, identifying the success factors and the reasons for challenges as well as documenting proposals from implementers to improve AI adoption in clinical settings. Results: We gathered the implementers' requirements for facilitating AI adoption in the clinical setting. The main findings include 1) the lesser importance of AI explainability in favor of proper clinical validation studies, 2) the need to actively involve clinical practitioners, and not only clinical researchers, in the inception of AI research projects, 3) the need for better information structures and processes to manage data access and the ethical approval of AI projects, 4) the need for better support for regulatory compliance and avoidance of duplications in data management approval bodies, 5) the need to increase both clinicians' and citizens' literacy as respects the benefits and limitations of AI, and 6) the need for better funding schemes to support the implementation, embedding, and validation of AI in the clinical workflow, beyond pilots. Conclusion: Participants in the interviews are positive about the future of AI in clinical settings. At the same time, they propose numerous measures to transfer research advances into implementations that will benefit healthcare personnel. Transferring AI research into benefits for healthcare workers and patients requires adjustments in regulations, data access procedures, education, funding schemes, and validation of AI systems.",ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2024.105377,,,,

Geospatial technologies have proven indispensable in assessing and tracking fundamental components of each of the 17 SDGs, including climatological and ecological trends, and changes and humanitarian crises and socio-economic impacts. However, gaps remain in the capacity for geospatial and related digital technologies, like AI, to provide a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the complex and multi-factorial challenges delineated in the SDGs. Lack of progress toward these goals, and the immense implementation challenges that remain, call for inclusive and holistic approaches, coupled with transformative uses of digital technologies. This paper reviews transdisciplinary, holistic, and participatory approaches to address gaps in ethics and diversity in geospatial and related technologies and to meet the pressing need for bottom-up, community-driven initiatives. Small-scale, community-based initiatives are known to have a systemic and aggregate effect toward macro-economic and global environmental goals. Cybernetic systems thinking approaches are the conceptual framework investigated in this study, as these approaches suggest that a decentralized, polycentric system-for example, each community acting as one node in a larger, global system-has the resilience and capacity to create and sustain positive change, even if it is counter to top-down decisions and mechanisms. Thus, this paper will discuss how holistic systems thinking-societal, political, environmental, and economic choices considered in an interrelated context-may be central to building true resilience to climate change and creating sustainable development pathways. Traditional and Indigenous knowledge (IK) systems around the world hold holistic awareness of human-ecological interactions-practicable, reciprocal relationships developed over time as a cultural approach. This cultural holistic approach is also known as Systemic Literacy, which considers how systems function beyond mechanical aspects and include political, philosophical, psychological, emotional, relational, anthropological, and ecological dimensions. When Indigenous-led, these dimensions can be unified into participatory, community-centered conservation practices that support long-term human and environmental well-being. There is a growing recognition of the criticality of Indigenous leadership in sustainability practices, as well as that partnerships with Indigenous peoples and weaving knowledge systems, as a missing link to approaching global ecological crises. This review investigates the inequality in technological systems-the digital divide that further inhibits participation by communities and groups that retain knowledge of place and may offer the most transformative solutions. Following the review and synthesis, this study presents cybernetics as a bridge of understanding to Indigenous systems thinking. As non-Indigenous scholars, we hope that this study serves to foster informed, productive, and respectful dialogues so that the strength of diverse knowledges might offer whole-systems approaches to decision making that tackle wicked problems. Lastly, we discuss use cases of community-based processes and co-developed geospatial technologies, along with ethical considerations, as avenues toward enhancing equity and making advances in democratizing and decolonizing technology.",MDPI,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi13040110,,,,

This allows for critical reflections on the making of meaning in prevalent narratives about A.I. and its impact. While research on the public perception of datafication and automation is growing, only a few studies investigate news framing practices. The present study connects to this nascent research area by charting A.I. news frames in four internationally renowned media outlets: The New York Times, The Guardian, Wired, and Gizmodo. The main goals are to identify dominant emphasis frames in AI news reporting over the past decade, to explore whether certain A.I. frames are associated with specific data risks (surveillance, data bias, cyber-war/cyber-crime, and information disorder), and what journalists and experts contribute to the media discourse. An automated content analysis serves for inductive frame detection (N = 3098), identification of risk references (dictionary-based), and network analysis of news writers. The results show how A.I.'s ubiquity emerged rapidly in the mid-2010s, and that the news discourse became more critical over time.

In this systematic review of literature, we aimed to analyze studies concerning the integration of AI in the continuous professional development (CPD) of teachers in order to generate a global vision on its potential to enhance the quality of CPD programs in the international level, and to provide recommendations for its application in the Moroccan context. To achieve our objective, we conducted a research that involves a review of international indexed databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Eric) published between 2019 and 2023 using PICO framework to formulate our search query and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework to select 25 relevant studies based on include and exclude criteria like publishing year, type of documents, publishing mode, subject area, language, and other criteria. The results reveal that AI integration has a positive impact on CPD programs by offering beneficial intelligent tools that can tailor adaptive training programs to meet teachers' specific needs, preferences, and proficiency levels. Furthermore, our findings identify the importance of integrating AI as a core topic within CPD programs to enhance teachers' AI literacy, enabling them to effectively navigate and utilize AI-based tools in their educational environment. This is important for preparing teachers to engage with the technological advances shaping the educational system. In conclusion, our systematic review emphasizes the significance of AI integration in CPD programs and offers tailored recommendations for its implementation in the Moroccan educational context.

This study examines the validity of rational bubbles in stock market prices, focusing on eight African stock markets: South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Morocco, Mauritius, Ghana, and Botswana. Utilizing newly developed econophysics-based unit root tests and the Dynamic Conditional Correlation Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (DCC MGARCH) models, the authors analyzed daily data from 1996 to 2022. Our findings indicate that these markets experienced bubbles at various points, often followed by bursts. These bubbles coincided with significant economic changes, suggesting a strong link between stock market behavior and economic growth. For instance, financial crises, political instability, and global economic downturns significantly influenced bubble formation and bursts in these markets. The study reveals that market-specific events, such as regulatory changes and shifts in investor sentiment, also contributed to the occurrence of bubbles. Three key policy options are proposed to address bubbles in the studied markets including, enhancing regulatory frameworks to monitor and mitigate bubble formation, improving financial literacy among investors to promote informed decision-making, and strengthening economic policies to stabilize macroeconomic conditions and reduce vulnerability to external shocks.

Many patients lack access to surgical care that optimizes outcomes. Scarce availability and/or low accessibility of appropriate resources may be the reason for this, especially in economically disadvantaged areas. This study aimed to investigate providers' and survivors' perspectives on barriers and facilitators to the availability and accessibility of surgical care. Methods: Semistructured interviews informed by surgical disparities and access-to-care conceptual frameworks with purposively selected GI cancer providers and survivors in Alabama and Mississippi were conducted. Survivors were within 3 years of diagnosis of stage I to III esophageal, pancreatic, or colorectal cancer. Transcripts were analyzed using inductive thematic and content analysis techniques. Intercoder agreement was reached at 90 %. Results: The 27 providers included surgeons (n = 11), medical oncologists (n = 2), radiation oncologists (n = 2), a primary care physician (n = 1), nurses (n = 8), and patient navigators (n = 3). This study included 36 survivors with ages ranging from 44 to 87 years. Of the 36 survivors, 21 (58.3 %) were male, and 11 (30.6 %) identified as Black. Responses were grouped into 3 broad categories: (i) transportation/geographic location, (ii) specialized care/ testing, and (iii) patient-/provider-related factors. The barriers included lack and cost of transportation, reluctance to travel because of uneasiness with urban centers, low availability of specialized care, overburdened referral centers, provider-related referral biases, and low health literacy. Facilitators included availability of charitable aid, centralizing multidisciplinary care, and efficient appointment scheduling. Conclusion: In the Deep South, barriers and facilitators to the availability and accessibility of GI surgical cancer care were identified at the health system, provider, and patient levels, especially for rural residents.

This study reveals that the predominant methodologies for developing AI literacy frameworks involve empirical research studies and literature reviews, adhering to national government or institutional standards. These frameworks commonly incorporate 1) Bloom's taxonomy or a similar progression framework, such as Use-Create-Modify, 2) constructionism, and 3) computer science perspectives such as theories of computation. The findings reveal that AI literacy is situated at the intersection of digital literacy, data literacy, computational thinking, and AI ethics, emphasizing the need for a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach that encompasses both technological and societal impacts. However, the study argues that the current paradigms of AI literacy frameworks for young students often emphasize constructionist perspectives without fully considering the interactions between human and technological agents. This gap highlights the necessity for a new conceptual framework that acknowledges both human and non-human agents in AI literacy education for young students. The research contributes by conceptualizing AI literacy and guiding policymakers and curriculum designers to implement holistic AI literacy education for young students.",ELSEVIER,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2024.100319,,,,

However, low acceptability of AI as a digital healthcare intervention among medical professionals threatens to undermine user uptake levels, hinder meaningful and optimal value-added engagement, and ultimately prevent these promising benefits from being realised. Understanding the factors underpinning AI acceptability will be vital for medical institutions to pinpoint areas of deficiency and improvement within their AI implementation strategies. This scoping review aims to survey the literature to provide a comprehensive summary of the key factors influencing AI acceptability among healthcare professionals in medical imaging domains and the different approaches which have been taken to investigate them. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed across five academic databases including Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Compendex, and Scopus from January 2013 to September 2023. This was done in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Overall, 31 articles were deemed appropriate for inclusion in the scoping review. Results: The literature has converged towards three overarching categories of factors underpinning AI acceptability including: user factors involving trust, system understanding, AI literacy, and technology receptiveness; system usage factors entailing value proposition, self-efficacy, burden, and workflow integration; and socioorganisational-cultural factors encompassing social influence, organisational readiness, ethicality, and perceived threat to professional identity. Yet, numerous studies have overlooked a meaningful subset of these factors that are integral to the use of medical AI systems such as the impact on clinical workflow practices, trust based on perceived risk and safety, and compatibility with the norms of medical professions. This is attributable to reliance on theoretical frameworks or ad-hoc approaches which do not explicitly account for healthcarespecific factors, the novelties of AI as software as a medical device (SaMD), and the nuances of human-AI interaction from the perspective of medical professionals rather than lay consumer or business end users. Conclusion: This is the first scoping review to survey the health informatics literature around the key factors influencing the acceptability of AI as a digital healthcare intervention in medical imaging contexts. The factors identified in this review suggest that existing theoretical frameworks used to study AI acceptability need to be modified to better capture the nuances of AI deployment in healthcare contexts where the user is a healthcare professional influenced by expert knowledge and disciplinary norms. Increasing AI acceptability among medical professionals will critically require designing human-centred AI systems which go beyond high algorithmic performance to consider accessibility to users with varying degrees of AI literacy, clinical workflow practices, the institutional and deployment context, and the cultural, ethical, and safety norms of healthcare professions. As investment into AI for healthcare increases, it would be valuable to conduct a systematic review and metaanalysis of the causal contribution of these factors to achieving high levels of AI acceptability among medical professionals.",ELSEVIER,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2023.102698,,,,

AI is revolutionising numerous fields, including the healthcare sector, globally. Incorporating AI in dental education may help in improving the diagnostic accuracy, learners' experiences, and effectiveness of the management of dental education institutions. However, successful implementation of AI requires the faculty's willingness to incorporate it into their practices. Thus, this research aims to explore the readiness of faculty members to integrate AI into dental education. Methodology The study employed a qualitative exploratory design to gather in-depth insights into faculty readiness for AI-driven dental education. Purposive sampling was employed, and 21 faculty members from public and private dental colleges in South Punjab participated in semi-structured interviews. The interviews focused on understanding participants' perceptions, experiences, and challenges related to AI integration in dental education. Thematic analysis was conducted utilising Braun and Clarke's framework to identify key themes and subthemes from the qualitative data using inductive coding. Results Five major themes and 14 subthemes emerged from the data analysis. Faculty members had low AI literacy coupled with diverse perceptions; some participants perceived AI as a solution for revolutionising teaching and learning, while others criticised its misuse as academic misconduct by students, an effect on students' critical thinking, and a threat to conventional jobs. However, most of the respondents also considered AI beneficial for students with remote access or from marginalised populations in terms of accessing and learning from limited resources. Concerns that participants highlighted included a lack of training opportunities, limited facilities, ethical concerns pertaining to data privacy, and assessment bias. Some of the recommendations provided by the respondents include the provision of training opportunities, the allocation of resources and infrastructure, and continuous effective support from institutions for the integration of AI in dental education. Conclusions This study emphasised the readiness of the faculty when it comes to the integration of AI in dental education. The faculty considered AI favourable for digitization and innovative education, although there is a lack of awareness of its application. Regarding the benefits of utilising AI, respondents highlighted its quick response, prediction of students' performance, and flexibility in learning. The challenges included lack of awareness regarding its implementation, inadequate training, lack of availability of resources, lack of institutional support, the problem of data confidentiality, and resistance to change. Suggestions included the provision of technical support, skills training, and the provision of required infrastructure. Participants recommended that AI tools must incorporate cultural and contextually specific content, use technical support for problems, and incorporate constant response systems to improve the AI tools for novice users, especially within developing regions such as Pakistan.",SPRINGERNATURE,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.64377,,,,

While current approaches using simulations and games can improve students' AI knowledge, they may not adequately prepare them for higher-level cognitive tasks. Only a few studies have explored the use of maker education to develop students' AI literacy. This case study employed a mixed-method approach and integrated AI into maker education to enhance students' motivation, career interest, confidence, collaboration, and AI literacy across low to high cognitive domains. The study involved 35 secondary school students in an AI maker program, where AI-driven recycling bins were employed as a project-based learning intervention. The results demonstrated a positive impact on students' motivation, AI literacy, and collaboration.

The introduction of generative AI (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, has posed opportunities and challenges to the traditional model of education. However, the current conversations primarily focus on policy development and assessment, with limited research on the future of higher education. GenAI's impact on learning outcomes, pedagogy, and assessment is crucial for reforming and advancing the workforce. This qualitative study aims to investigate student perspectives on GenAI's impact on higher education. The study uses an initial conceptual framework driven by a systematic literature review to investigate the opportunities and challenges of AI in education. This framework serves as an initial data collection and analysis framework. A sample of 51 students from three research-intensive universities was selected for this study. Thematic analysis identified three themes and 10 subthemes. The findings suggest that future higher education should be transformed to train students to be future-ready for employment in a society powered by GenAI. They suggest new learning outcomes-skills in learning and teaching with GenAI, AI literacy-and emphasize the significance of interdisciplinarity and maker learning, with assessment focusing on in-class and hands-on activities.

Incorporating education for sustainable development within a radiography curriculum: A narrative review,RADIOGRAPHY,Review,Sustainable development; Radiography education; Training; Climate change; Sustainability; Carbon footprint,"Objectives: This narrative review aims to describe opportunities to embed sustainability as a core concept in radiography education by exploring teaching strategies to increase awareness about sustainability and its importance in radiography; encourage a culture of personal responsibility and investigate effective teaching methods to engage students in exploring sustainable radiography practices. Climate change can adversely affect the health of populations worldwide. Medical imaging and radiotherapy services are recognised as substantial contributors to the ecological impact of the healthcare industry. There is a need to address the inclusion of sustainability in radiography education due to its increasing relevance to complex cultural and environmental problems. Key findings: Literature searches were conducted using CINAHL and Google Scholar, focusing on keywords such as Sustainability, Healthcare, and Radiography Curriculum. A variety of teaching strategies are available to facilitate the instruction of sustainable healthcare practices. Many pedagogical methods promote emancipation and transformative learning, such as problem-based learning, case-study learning, debate, and participatory action research, contributing to a student-centred learning experience. Traditional lecturing and interprofessional teaching also enhance the learner experience by stimulating new ways of thinking. Conclusion: Communicating about climate change is important. The radiography curriculum should include education on sustainability for meaningful global health literacy, encourage active research involvement, and ensure that sustainable healthcare principles are incorporated into daily practice. Implications to practice: Radiographers possess the ability to assess the various elements influencing a patient's health status and identify which aspects might affect their capacity for behaviour change. This empowers patients to effectively control their conditions within the framework of personalised care. Radiographers have the potential to motivate actions, shape policies, and drive transformation as advocates for environmental and health messengers. (c) 2024 The College of Radiographers.

Given the complexity in the formulation of structural design problems, the process of optimization is commonly performed using artificial intelligence (AI) global optimization, such as the genetic algorithm (GA). However, the integration of AI-based optimization, together with visual programming (VP), in building information modeling (BIM) projects warrants further investigation. This study proposes a workflow by combining structure analysis, VP, BIM, and GA to optimize trusses. The methodology encompasses several steps, including the following: (i) generation of parametric trusses in Dynamo VP; (ii) performing finite element modeling (FEM) using Robot Structural Analysis (RSA); (iii) retrieving and evaluating the FEM results interchangeably between Dynamo and RSA; (iv) finding the best solution using GA; and (v) importing the optimized model into Revit, enabling the user to perform simulations and engineering analysis, such as life cycle assessment (LCA) and quantity surveying. This methodology provides a new interoperable framework with minimal interference with existing supply-chain processes, and it will be flexible to technology literacy and allow architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) professionals to employ VP, global optimization, and FEM in BIM-based projects by leveraging open-sourced software and tools, together with commonly used design software. The feasibility of the proposed workflow was tested on benchmark problems and compared with the open literature. The outcomes of this study offer insight into the opportunities and limitations of combining VP, GA, FEA, and BIM for structural optimization applications, particularly to enhance structural efficiency and sustainability in construction. Despite the success of this study in developing a workable, user-friendly, and interoperable framework for the utilization of VP, GA, FEM, and BIM for structural optimization, the results obtained could be improved by (i) increasing the callback function speed between Dynamo and RSA through specialized application programming interface (API); and (ii) fine-tuning the GA parameters or utilizing other advanced global optimization and supervised learning techniques for the optimization.",MDPI,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings14061532,,,,

The major frameworks are focused on identifying content and technical knowledge (AI literacy). Most of the current definitions of AI literacy for a non -technical audience are developed from an engineering perspective and may not be appropriate for K-12 education. Teacher perspectives are essential to making sense of this initiative. Literacy is about knowing (knowledge, what skills); competency is about applying the knowledge in a beneficial way (confidence, how well). They are strongly related. This study goes beyond knowledge (AI literacy), and its two main goals are to (i) define AI literacy and competency by adding the aspects of confidence and self -reflective mindsets, and (ii) propose a more comprehensive framework for K-12 AI education. These definitions are needed for this emerging and disruptive technology (e.g., ChatGPT and Sora, generative AI). We used the definitions and the basic curriculum design approaches as the analytical framework and teacher perspectives. Participants included 30 experienced AI teachers from 15 middle schools. We employed an iterative co -design cycle to discuss and revise the framework throughout four cycles. The definition of AI competency has five abilities that take confidence into account, and the proposed framework comprises five key components: technology, impact, ethics, collaboration, and self -reflection.

Permeating many aspects of our lives and influencing our choices, development in this field continues to advance and increasingly impacts us as individuals and our society. The risks and unintended effects such as bias from input data or algorithm design have recently stirred discourse about how to inform and teach AI in K-12 education. As AI is a new topic not only for pupils in K-12 but also for teachers, new skill sets are required that enable critical engagement with AI. AI literacy is trying to close the gap between research and practical knowledge transfer of AI-related skills. Teachers' AI-related technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) are important factors for AI literacy. However, as teachers' perspectives, beliefs and views impact both the interpretation and operationalisation of curriculum. this study explores teachers' and teacher educators' understanding and preconceptions of AI to inform teacher education and professional development. To gain a comprehensive understanding of teachers' conceptualisations regarding AI an anonymous questionnaire together with focus group discussions were employed. The qualitative content analysis underpinned by the theoretical framework Intelligent TPACK reveals that teachers' AI-related content knowledge is generally gained through incidental learning and often results in pre- and misconceptions of AI. Our analysis also revealed several potential challenges for teachers in achieving core constructs of Intelligent TPACK, examples of such challenges are vague and unclear guidelines in both policy and curriculum, a lack of understanding of AI and its limitations, as well as emotional responses related to participants' preconceptions.

Methods: Video and audio data illustrating 41 students' application of critical thinking were collected using a unique display recording app installed on iPads. These were timeline analysed using a literature-generated framework comprising Indicators of critical thinking. Interview data were thematically analysed to build knowledge of teacher pedagogical and school factors supporting the curriculum. Results: Data indicated students mostly applied critical thinking for defining and clarifying concepts, presenting reasoned arguments and conclusions, questioning and challenging others' perspectives, seeking evidence for claims made, and identifying and critiquing assumptions. Results highlight the important contribution of teacher theoretical knowledge, school-wide commitment to a 'critical thinking' curriculum, and common understanding of the broader purpose schooling, as foundational to the curriculum's success. Conclusion: Teaching for critical thinking was facilitated by close alignment between pedagogical, technological, and school environment factors. It was underpinned by a school-wide learning virtues and values framework emphasising students' future competencies developed from extensive reading of research and learning theory, and was deliberately planned for. It reflected in theory-informed task design, technology selection, and pedagogy. Practice: Critical thinking has been identified in school curricula as an important capability. However, while imperatives and general principles promoting critical thinking in schools are detailed in official documents, few examples exist illustrating how critical thinking can be fostered in K-6 education. Implications: Explicit teaching for critical thinking should be considered a priority by teachers at all school levels.

Despite Sweden's advanced digitalization efforts and the widespread application of AI in the public sector, our study reveals significant gaps between theoretical ambitions and practical outcomes, particularly in the context of AI's trustworthiness. We employ a robust theoretical framework comprising Institutional Theory, the Resource -Based View (RBV), and Ambidexterity Theory, to analyze the challenges and discrepancies in AI implementation within PES. Our analysis shows that while AI promises enhanced decision -making efficiency, the reality is marred by issues of transparency, interpretability, and stakeholder engagement. The opacity of the neural network used by the agency to assess jobseekers' need for support and the lack of comprehensive technical understanding among PES management contribute to the challenges in achieving transparent and interpretable AI systems. Economic pressures for efficiency often overshadow the need for ethical considerations and stakeholder involvement, leading to decisions that may not be in the best interest of jobseekers. We propose recommendations for enhancing AI's trustworthiness in public services, emphasizing the importance of stakeholder engagement, particularly involving jobseekers in the decision -making process. Our study advocates for a more nuanced balance between the use of advanced AI technologies and the leveraging of internal resources such as skilled personnel and organizational knowledge. We also highlight the need for improved AI literacy among both management and personnel to effectively navigate AI's integration into public decision -making processes.

Employing a rigorous two-part methodology, the initial phase scrutinises 28 studies from the SCOPUS database, unveiling five distinct discourses germane to AI literacy. Subsequently, the second phase involves the administration of questionnaires to 73 students, whose responses undergo thematic analysis to discern patterns within the four domains delineated by Ng et al. The ensuing discourse underscores a pivotal revelation: despite formal adherence to established discourses, the conceptualisation of AI literacy necessitates a departure from conventional perspectives. Ethical principles, elucidated by students, emerge not merely as individual components but as integral facets of a broader societal literacy profile, thereby advocating a paradigm shift towards social reflection.

Participants were asked to imagine that they needed a total hip replacement surgery and to indicate whether they would prefer a traditional or a robot-assisted (RA) hip surgery. To better understand preferences for the chosen method, the willingness to pay (WTP) method was used. The same assessment was conducted for preferences between a radiologist's and AI-based image analysis in establishing the radiological diagnosis of a suspected tumour. Respondents' electronic health literacy was assessed with the eHEALS questionnaire. Descriptive methods were used to assess sample characteristics and differences between subgroups. Associations were investigated with correlation analysis and multiple linear regressions.Results Altogether, 1400 individuals (53.7% female) with a mean age of 58.3 (SD = 11.1) years filled in the survey. RA hip surgery was chosen by 762 (54.4%) respondents, but only 470 (33.6%) chose AI-based medical image evaluation. Those who opted for the digital technology had significantly higher educational levels and electronic health literacy (eHEALS). The majority of respondents were willing to pay to secure their preferred surgical (surgeon 67.2%, robot-assisted: 68.8%) and image assessment (radiologist: 70.9%; AI: 77.4%) methods, reporting similar average amounts in the first (p = 0.677), and a significantly higher average amount for radiologist vs. AI in the second task (p = 0.001). The regression showed a significant association between WTP and income, and in the hip surgery task, it also revealed an association with the type of intervention chosen.Conclusions Individuals with higher education levels seem to accept the advanced digital medical technologies more. However, the greater openness for RA surgery than for AI image assessment highlights that social preferences may depend considerably on the medical situation and the type of advanced digital technology. WTP results suggest rather firm preferences in the great majority of the cases. Determinants of preferences and real-world choices of affected patients should be further investigated in future studies.",BMC,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12911-024-02470-x,,,,

Methods: We created a database of academic medical centers from the full list of Association of American Medical Colleges hospital and health system members in 2022. Stratifying by census region and restricting to nonfederal and nonspecialty centers, we recruited chief medical informatics officers and similarly positioned individuals from academic medical centers across the country. We created and piloted a semistructured interview guide focused on (1) how academic medical centers govern artificial intelligence and prediction and (2) to what extent equity is considered in these processes. A total of 17 individuals representing 13 institutions across 4 census regions of the US were interviewed. Results: A minority of participants reported considering inequity, racism, or bias in governance. Most participants conceptualized these issues as characteristics of a tool, using frameworks such as algorithmic bias or fairness. Fewer participants conceptualized equity beyond the technology itself and asked broader questions about its implications for patients. Disparities in health information technology resources across health systems were repeatedly identified as a threat to health equity. Conclusions: We found a lack of consistent equity consideration among academic medical centers as they develop their governance processes for predictive technologies despite considerable national attention to the ways these technologies can cause or reproduce inequities.

This scoping review aimed to identify the barriers encountered in applying innovative AI techniques and models in developing breast cancer risk prediction scores and promoting screening behaviors among adult females. Findings may inform and guide future global recommendations for AI application in breast cancer prevention and care for female populations. Methods: The PRISMA-SCR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) was used as a reference checklist throughout this study. The Arksey and O'Malley methodology was used as a framework to guide this review. The framework methodology consisted of five steps: (1) Identify research questions; (2) Search for relevant studies; (3) Selection of studies relevant to the research questions; (4) Chart the data; (5) Collate, summarize, and report the results. Results: In the field of breast cancer risk detection and prevention, the following AI techniques and models have been applied: Machine and Deep Learning Model (ML-DL model) (n = 1), Academic Algorithms (n = 2), Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), Clinical 5-Year Risk Prediction Model (n = 2), deep-learning computer vision AI algorithms (n = 2), AI-based thermal imaging solution (Thermalytix) (n = 1), RealRisks (n = 2), Breast Cancer Risk NAVIgation (n = 1), MammoRisk (ML-Based Tool) (n = 1), Various MLModels (n = 1), and various machine/deep learning, decision aids, and commercial algorithms (n = 7). In the 11 included studies, a total of 39 barriers to AI applications in breast cancer risk prediction and screening efforts were identified. The most common barriers in the application of innovative AI tools for breast cancer prediction and improved screening rates included lack of external validity and limited generalizability (n = 6), as AI was used in studies with either a small sample size or datasets with missing data. Many studies (n = 5) also encountered selection bias due to exclusion of certain populations based on characteristics such as race/ethnicity, family history, or past medical history. Several recommendations for future research should be considered. AI models need to include a broader spectrum and more complete predictive variables for risk assessment. Investigating long-term outcomes with improved follow-up periods is critical to assess the impacts of AI on clinical decisions beyond just the immediate outcomes. Utilizing AI to improve communication strategies at both a local and organizational level can assist in informed decision-making and compliance, especially in populations with limited literacy levels. Conclusions: The use of AI in patient education and as an adjunctive tool for providers is still early in its incorporation, and future research should explore the implementation of AI-driven resources to enhance understanding and decision-making regarding breast cancer screening, especially in vulnerable populations with limited literacy.",MDPI,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm13092525,,,,

Despite the benefits, the current oversaturation of information necessitates the support of healthcare professionals. Help-seeking behavior (HSB) is a term that describes the actions taken to assuage health concerns, and timely medical consultations are critical, especially for older individuals in rural areas who often face barriers to accessing care. These challenges are exacerbated by the perceived psychological distance from medical services in rural settings due to past negative experiences; however, the emergence of social media has helped form a bridge, allowing for direct communication with physicians. While consultations with artificial intelligence (AI) do occur, interaction with human physicians remains the gold standard. Thus, this study sought to understand social media's role in facilitating health consultations in rural areas and the implications for primary care education among physicians.MethodsThis qualitative study, conducted from September 2022 to June 2023, employed a grounded theory approach to analyze information about a social network-based consulting system that utilized the LINE application. Residents posted anonymous health-related concerns, and comments were extracted. Two researchers coded and assessed the data; another specialist reviewed the findings.ResultsA total of 621 citizens participated, generating 10,432 posts. The grounded theory approach identified five major themes regarding health-related social networking in rural settings: (1) mutual exploration for information sharing highlighted distrust toward primary care physicians; (2) temporary collaboration resulted in superficial health discussions and relationship-building through empathy; (3) conflicts arising from differing health perspectives and misinformation sharing led to intense debates; (4) anxiety was resolved through shared illness experiences and increased empathy, enhancing psychological safety; and (5) a mutual assistance community was created, characterized by improved health dialogues and HSB among participants.ConclusionsThe high engagement with the social network-based consulting system in rural Unnan City highlights technology's pivotal role in facilitating health dialogue and community engagement, despite challenges related to misinformation and health literacy complexities.

However, users have observed that the efficacy of AI assistants hinges crucially on the quality of the prompts supplied to them. A slight alteration in wording can make the difference between an assistant misinterpreting an instruction and exceeding expectations. The skill of precisely communicating the essence of a problem to an AI assistant is as crucial as the assistant itself. This paper aims to introduce Prompt Engineering (PE) as an emerging skill essential for personal and professional learning and development in the 21st century. We define PE as the skill of articulating a problem, its context, and the constraints of the desired solution to an AI assistant, ensuring a swift and accurate response. We show that no existing related frameworks on 21st skills and others cover PE to the extent that allows for its valid assessment and targeted promotion in school and university education. Thus, we propose a conceptual framework for this skill set including (1) comprehension of the basic prompt structure, (2) prompt literacy, (3) the method of prompting, and (4) critical online reasoning. We also discuss the implications and challenges for the assessment framework of this skill set and highlight current PE-related recommendations for researchers and educators.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2024.1366434,,,,

School-supervised asthma therapy (SST) is an evidence-based strategy that improves asthma outcomes, particularly for historically marginalized children, by providing support for daily medication adherence in school. However, little is known about the relationship between these programs and the adverse SDoH commonly affecting underrepresented minority and marginalized children with asthma.MethodsWe examined qualitative data from interviews (n = 52) conducted between 2017 and 2020 with diverse multi-level partners involved in Asthma Link, a SST intervention. Participants included end-users (children and their parents), deliverers (school nurses and pediatric providers), and systems-level partners (e.g., insurers, legislators, and state officials). We used inductive coding to determine themes and subthemes and deductive coding using the Healthy People 2030 SDoH framework.ResultsThree themes emerged: (1) SST mitigates adverse SDoH (improves access to preventive healthcare and asthma health literacy), (2) SST benefits children experiencing specific adverse SDoH (provides a consistent medication routine to children with unstable family/housing situations) and (3) specific adverse SDoH impede SST implementation (economic instability, culture and language barriers).ConclusionThis study suggests an important relationship between SDoH and SST that warrants further evaluation in our future work on this community-based asthma intervention. Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of measuring SDoH in the implementation and evaluation of pediatric asthma interventions, particularly given the strong influence of these social factors on child health outcomes.",WILEY,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppul.27065,,,,

As data and generative AI become more powerful, what does it mean to learn, teach, create, make meaning, and express ourselves, even as machines are trained to take care of these tasks for us? With youth, and in the context of literacy and media education, we embrace this moment to broaden our social imaginations. Our collaboration with journalists ages 14-25 from 2019 to 2023 has yielded a corpus of over 30 multimodal compositions constructed with and/or about AI reaching audiences in the millions. On the basis of these youth texts - produced within our participatory research at YR Media, a national STEAM learning center and platform for emerging BIPOC content creators - we developed the conceptual framework presented here: Humanizing Data Expression (HDE). The key role of expression in HDE distinguishes the human from the machine through the lens of storytelling. Analysis of this corpus (podcasts, web-based interactives, videos, radio features, online posts, social media assets) revealed four literacy practices of YR Media authors as they made sense of AI: (1) contextualize: try out AI-powered features, reveal how it works; (2) unveil authorship: introduce AI creators and processes; (3) grapple: explore tensions and paradoxes; (4) play: hack, mess with, outsmart, exaggerate AI.

The approach to managing primary liver tumours involves specialised teams, including surgeons, radiologists, oncologists, pathologists, hepatologists, and radiation oncologists, coming together to propose individualised treatment plans. The evolving landscape of primary liver cancer treatment introduces complexities, particularly with the expanding array of systemic and locoregional therapies, alongside the potential integration of molecular biology and artificial intelligence (AI) into MDTBs in the future. Precision medicine demands collaboration across disciplines, challenging traditional frameworks. In the next decade, we anticipate the convergence of AI, molecular biology, pathology, and advanced imaging, requiring adaptability in MDTB structure to incorporate these cutting-edge technologies. Navigating this evolution also requires a focus on enhancing basic, translational, and clinical research, as well as boosting clinical trials through an upgraded use of MDTBs as hubs for scientific collaboration and raising literacy about AI and new technologies. In this review, we will delineate the current unmet needs in the clinical management of primary liver cancers, discuss our perspective on the future role of MDTBs in primary liver cancers (next generation MDTBs), and unravel the potential power and limitations of novel technologies that may shape the multidisciplinary care landscape for primary liver cancers in the coming decade.

This study evaluated available online resources for SHPT from ESKD based on information quality and readability. Methods: Three search engines were queried using the terms parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroidectomy kidney/renal failure, parathyroidectomy dialysis patients, should I have surgery for hyperparathyroidism due to kidney failure?, and do I need surgery for hyperparathyroidism due to kidney failure if I do not have symptoms? Websites were categorized by source and origin. Two independent reviewers determined information quality using JAMA (0-4) and DISCERN (1-5) frameworks, and scores were averaged. Cohen's kappa evaluated inter-rater reliability. Readability was determined using the Flesch Kincaid Reading Ease, Flesch Kincaid Grade Level, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook tools. Median readability scores were calculated, and corresponding grade level determined. Websites with reading difficulties >6th grade level were calculated. Results: Thirty one (86.1%) websites originated from the U.S., with most from hospital-associated (63.9%) and foundation/advocacy sources (30.6%). The mean JAMA and DISCERN scores for all websites were 1.3 +/- 1.4 and 2.6 +/- 0.7, respectively. Readability scores ranged from grade level 5-college level, and most websites scored above the recommended 6th grade level.

At the same time, language is central to the functioning of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). On this common basis concerning the role of language, this paper explores how foundational ideas from LLSE studies can inform the use of GenAI in science education. A bibliometric analysis of 412 journal articles from Web of Science provided the initial step to identify major themes and relationships in the LLSE literature. The analysis revealed four clusters of research in LLSE: reading and writing scientific text, science discourse and interaction, multilingual science classroom, and multimodality and representations. Each cluster was further analyzed through close reading of selected articles to identify and connect key constructs to the potential use of GenAI. These constructs include the interactive-constructive reading model, text genre, reading-writing integration, dialogic interaction, critical questioning, argumentation, translanguaging, hybridity, thematic pattern, modal affordance, and transduction. From these ideas and connections, the paper recommends several pedagogical principles for science educators to guide the use of GenAI. It concludes that LLSE research offers valuable insights for researchers and teachers to investigate and design the use of GenAI in science education. In turn, the impending use of GenAI also calls for a rethinking of literacy that will shape future research in LLSE.",WILEY,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sce.21875,,,,

In primary and secondary schools, artificial intelligence (AI) education plays a pivotal role in fostering digital literacy. To comprehensively investigate the variables influencing AI education in primary and secondary schools, a dynamic system model was constructed based on the CIPP (Context, Input, Process, and Product) education evaluation model. We employed a mixed-method research approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative methods, to thoroughly investigate the influencing factors and perform predictive and simulation experiments. Firstly, we construct a system framework for AI education in primary and secondary schools based on CIPP model, utilizing qualitative methods such as literature review and expert interviews to identify influencing factors and define the system's boundaries. Secondly, we collect 814 questionnaire responses from 12 primary and secondary schools and employ Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) for quantitative analysis to explore the relationships between these influencing factors. Finally, these relationships are utilized to construct a System Dynamics model, allowing for an in-depth exploration of the development trends in AI education in primary and secondary schools through predictive analysis and control simulation. Controlled simulations allow us to predict and validate factors that influence the level of AI education development, aiding in the identification of high-leverage elements. Our findings underscore that AI education in Chinese primary and secondary schools is still in its initial stage with insufficient developmental momentum. Through controlled simulation results, it is found that the development of AI education in primary and secondary schools is influenced by both external systems and internal student systems, with national policy serving as the fundamental driving force. Among these influencing factors, societal factors play a predominant role in the external environment, followed by school factors, while the students' level of learning engagement is identified as the most crucial factor within the internal system. Based on the results of prediction and simulation studies, recommendations for improvement are proposed, including policy reforms and collaboration between schools and enterprises.",SPRINGER,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10639-024-12470-z,,,,

This framework and its potential variations, tailored to different learner groups (by educational level and discipline), can serve as a crucial reference for designing and implementing AI curricula. However, the research on AI literacy by target learners is still in its infancy, and the findings of several existing studies provide inconsistent guidelines for educational practices. Following the 2020 PRISMA guidelines, we searched the Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases to identify relevant studies published between January 2012 and October 2024. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using QualSyst. A total of 29 studies were identified, and their research findings were synthesized. Results show that at the K-12 level, the required competencies include basic AI knowledge, device usage, and AI ethics. For higher education, the focus shifts to understanding data and algorithms, problem-solving, and career-related competencies. For general workforce, emphasis is placed on the interpretation and utilization of data and AI tools for specific careers, along with error detection and AI-based decision-making. This study connects the progression of specific learning objectives, which should be intensively addressed at each stage, to propose an AI literacy education pathway. We discuss the findings, potentials, and limitations of the derived competency framework for AI literacy, including its theoretical and practical implications and future research suggestions.Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic AI literacy is becoming increasingly important as AI technologies are integrated into various aspects of life and work. Research on AI literacy competencies across diverse learner groups and disciplines remains fragmented and inconsistent to guide educational practices.

However, they are not yet reliable for self-triage or diagnostics. Health literacy plays a role in their use, but the process from symptom recognition to health care consultation remains unclear. Objective: This qualitative observatory study explored how laypersons use symptom checkers, focusing on the process of use, entry points and outcomes, and the role of health literacy. Laypersons are defined as individuals who are neither medical professionals nor developers of such apps. Three research questions were addressed: (1) How do such users describe the process of using symptom checkers? (2) What are entry points and possible outcomes of symptom checker app use? (3) How are health literacy and eHealth literacy expressed during the use of symptom checker apps? Methods: As part of the Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications of Symptom CheckerApps in Primary Health Care project, 15 laypersons (no9, 60% female and no6, 40% male; mean age 30.7, SD 13.6 years) were interviewed about their experiences with the symptom checker Ada. The interviews were analyzed using an integrative approach combining social positioning, agency, and the Rubicon model as a heuristic framework. Results: App use follows a cyclic process comprising 4 steps: motivation (influenced by biography and context), intention formation (assigning a purpose), intention implementation (recruiting resources), and evaluation (transforming interactions into health-related insights). Biographical, social, and contextual factors shape process initiation. Users use symptom checkers for 3 main purposes: understanding their condition, receiving recommendations for action, and documenting or communicating health-related information. Each purpose requires specific planning and integration into health-related behaviors drawing on personal, social, and technological resources. Evaluation depends on contextual factors, app outputs, and the outcomes of users' health-relatedactions. Users assess whether the app aligns with their expectations, condition severity, and previousexperiences, with health literacy playing a critical role invalidation processes. Conclusions: Symptom checker use is a complex, cyclic process shaped by context, biography, and health literacy. Users are motivated by health concerns influenced by personal, social, and contextual factors, with trust and attitudes impacting initial engagement. Intention formation reflects a balance between user skills and context, where app outputs inform decisions but may not always leadtoaction, especially inambiguous situations. Users rely on personal resources and social networks tointegrate app use into health-related behaviors, highlighting the limitations of symptom checkers in providing social or empathetic support.Symptom checkers have the potentialto serve as an interface between users and health care, but future development must address the complexity of their use to unlock this potential.

Rethinking AI's role in digital education,QUALITATIVE RESEARCH JOURNAL,Article; Early Access,AI-Driven learning; Learner autonomy; Digital equity; Knowledge co-construction; Algorithmic bias; Lifelong learning,"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to critically investigate the effects of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven learning environments on learner autonomy, knowledge co-construction and digital equity in Thailand's online education context. It aims to analyze how algorithmic learning tools and AI-based systems shape learners' educational experiences, particularly focusing on whether these technologies enhance or constrain learner autonomy and collaborative interactions. Additionally, it evaluates ethical and social implications, particularly the digital divide, algorithmic biases and the transparency of AI-mediated educational processes. The study seeks to provide actionable insights and recommendations for policymakers, educators and developers to optimize AI integration for inclusive lifelong learning.Design/methodology/approachThis research adopts a qualitative case study methodology involving in-depth, semi-structured interviews, participant observations and detailed document analysis from 30 diverse participants, including urban and rural learners, educators and instructional designers. Employing actor-network theory (ANT) and posthumanist theoretical frameworks, the study critically examines interactions between human and non-human actors within AI-driven educational environments. This approach allows for comprehensive exploration of participants' lived experiences, perceptions and interactions with AI technologies. Triangulation of multiple data sources ensures depth and reliability, providing nuanced insights into how AI systems influence learner autonomy, collaborative learning processes and educational equity.FindingsThe study identifies AI-driven learning platforms as having dual impacts on learner autonomy, simultaneously enabling greater self-directed learning through personalized guidance and real-time feedback while imposing algorithmic constraints that restrict intellectual exploration. AI-facilitated knowledge co-construction effectively organizes and structures peer interactions yet often results in depersonalized, transactional communication lacking deep human engagement. Furthermore, significant digital inequities are evident, with rural learners disproportionately disadvantaged due to limited technological infrastructure and algorithmic biases embedded within AI-driven platforms. These inequities highlight a critical need for inclusive, transparent and ethical design practices to ensure equitable access and meaningful learner agency.Research limitations/implicationsThe qualitative, context-specific nature of the case study limits the generalizability of findings beyond Thailand's online educational environment. The rapidly evolving nature of AI technologies suggests that findings reflect a specific temporal context, necessitating continuous research updates. Participant selection bias may have influenced findings, with participants potentially holding strong pre-existing opinions on AI-driven education. Future studies should consider longitudinal analyses to understand long-term impacts, comparative cross-cultural research to validate findings and deeper exploration of algorithmic biases, fairness and ethical considerations in AI-driven educational tools, particularly how they affect diverse socio-economic groups.Practical implicationsPractically, this research underscores the necessity of designing AI-driven learning platforms that genuinely empower learner autonomy and critical thinking rather than restrict or overly dictate educational pathways. Educational practitioners and technology developers should implement transparent AI decision-making processes, enabling learners to understand and critically evaluate algorithmic recommendations. Policies must prioritize digital infrastructure expansion and digital literacy programs to reduce urban-rural digital disparities. Furthermore, pedagogical practices should integrate human-centric approaches to complement AI tools, ensuring that AI technologies serve to enhance, rather than replace, essential human interactions within collaborative learning environments.Social implicationsThe study emphasizes that AI-driven education holds significant potential for democratizing lifelong learning by offering personalized and adaptive learning experiences. However, it also warns of the risks associated with reinforcing existing socio-economic and digital inequalities, particularly between urban and rural learners. Addressing algorithmic biases and digital divides through targeted policy interventions, infrastructural investments and inclusive educational practices is critical for fostering equity and inclusivity in education. By ensuring that AI platforms are accessible and beneficial for all learner demographics, societies can leverage technology as a tool for broad-based educational empowerment and social development rather than a mechanism perpetuating exclusion.Originality/valueThis research contributes original insights into the nuanced impacts of AI-driven learning on learner autonomy, collaborative interactions and digital equity within the Thai educational context - areas relatively underexplored in existing literature. By uniquely integrating actor-network theory and posthumanist perspectives, it offers a sophisticated understanding of the interplay between humans and technologies in educational settings. The empirical findings deliver crucial evidence-based recommendations for educators, policymakers and developers aiming to ethically and inclusively leverage AI in education. Ultimately, the study enriches ongoing discussions on balancing technological advancement with human-centric, equitable and socially responsible educational practices.",EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,2025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/QRJ-11-2024-0282,,,,

Nevertheless, HCSM technologies have been struggling to reach their full potential due to the lack of digital literacy among manufacturing workers, particularly in real-time machine monitoring. Current monitoring systems with rigid interfaces limit the operators to handle Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems to directly query manufacturing data for further analysis without external technical support. To address such bottlenecks, we propose ChatCNC, a conversational machine monitoring framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable natural language-driven interactions with real-time Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine data. Leveraging LLMbased multi-agent collaboration and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), ChatCNC interactively retrieves data from real-time IIoT database while also supporting context-aware responses based on the collected data, which reduces reliance on technical support from software engineers. As ChatCNC allows rapid adaptation of LLM Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) via prompting techniques, its performance is evaluated across multiple versions, each combining different LLMs and prompts, using various types of questions. Notably, our framework demonstrates its reliability in human-data interaction for industrial applications, achieving 93.3% accuracy in responding to complex queries that require advanced data inference like production tracking. Furthermore, possible failure modes are thoroughly analyzed based on interaction scenarios among multiple LLM-based agents.

Through an innovative cross-national mixed-methods design, we examined 330 secondary school students across the UK, Greece, and Brazil who developed AI competencies while addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through open schooling initiatives. Our theoretical innovation synthesises UNESCO's AI Competencies Framework with the CARE-KNOW-DO pedagogical model, generating transformative insights into AI literacy. We conceptualise AI literacy as a dynamic interplay of understanding, applying, and creating AI through social practice, where learners develop ethical awareness (CARE), epistemic-technical competence (KNOW), and responsible agency (DO) within authentic learning ecosystems. Employing a concurrent triangulation methodology of teaching and learning, we collected comprehensive longitudinal data through teacher ethnographic accounts, student self-assessments, STEM researchers' observations and granular analysis of AI-enabled project work over a year. This robust methodological approach revealed seven dimensions of AI-supported competency linked to transversal skills development across three distinct but interrelated domains. CARE (Understanding AI) highlights how proactive exploration and affective engagement emerge socially. KNOW (Applying AI) demonstrates how problem-solving, STEM for sustainability, and future prospects become embodied through application. DO (Creating AI) reveals how scientific citizenship and authentic learning with AI catalyse new forms of participation. This research advances sociocultural learning theory in three significant ways: (1) it empirically explicates how AI competencies develop through social practice in underserved communities, challenging existing theoretical paradigms; (2) it provides a comprehensive, evidence-based framework for equitable AI education integration across disciplines; and (3) it demonstrates how open schooling methodologies can foster transformative learning experiences that prepare students for an AI-driven future while promoting social justice and sustainable development. The findings have profound implications for educational policy and practice, suggesting a fundamental reconceptualization of AI literacy development in secondary education. This work establishes a new theoretical foundation for understanding how schools can systematically develop AI competencies while addressing critical issues of equity, inclusion, and sustainable development in an increasingly AI-mediated world.",SPRINGER,2025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40593-025-00458-w,,,,

Digital competence is seen as key to employment, education, and social domains in the 21st century. At the same time, there is no universal framework for studying attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI) and its use in professional and personal life. Aim. The aim of the present research is to outline respondents' attitudes towards the benefits and threats of AI that may facilitate or hinder the process of intelligent AI integration into different aspects of life. Methodology and research methods. This article outlines results from a pilot study of attitudes towards AI, conducted with a sample of 125 Bulgarian students and professionals. The research design is mixed (quantitative and qualitative) and includes questionnaire, focus groups and interviews. Results and scientific novelty. The results reveal that both young people and adults base their opinions on their assessment of AI performance and find positive implications in terms of facilitating task performance, but have strong reservations concerning job security and the use of AI in the social sphere. They also suggest that AI skills need to become integrated into education. Future research directions highlighted include differentiating between educational, professional, and personal domains and self-assessing digital literacy from an evidence-based vs. state of the art perspective.

Researchers and designers increasingly rely on this data and appeal to several approaches to collect it. One of these is data donation, which encourages people to voluntarily transfer their (personal) data collected by external parties to a specific cause. One of the central pillars of data donation is informed consent, meaning people should be adequately informed about what and how their data will be used. However, can we be adequately informed when it comes to donating our data when many times we don't even know it is being collected and, even more so, what exactly is being collected? In this paper, we investigate how to foster (personal) data literacy and increase donors' understanding of their data. We introduce a Research through Design approach where we define a data donation journey in the context of speech records, data collected by Google Assistant. Based on the data donation experiences of 22 donors, we propose a data donation framework that understands and approaches data donation as an encompassing process with mutual benefit for donors and researchers. Our framework supports a donation process that dynamically and iteratively engages donors in exploring and understanding their data and invites them to (re)evaluate and (re)assess their participation.

Their fast pace of adoption and probable effect has also given rise to controversy within certain fields. Models, such as GPT-3, are a particular concern for professionals engaged in writing, particularly as their engagement with these technologies is limited due to lack of ability to control their output. Most efforts to maximize and control output rely on a process known as prompt engineering, the construction and modification of the inputted prompt with expectation for certain outputted or desired text. Consequently, prompt engineering has emerged as an important consideration for research and practice. Previous conceptions of prompt engineering have largely focused on technical and logistic modifications to the back-end processing, remaining inaccessible and, still, limited for most users. In this paper, we look to the technical communication field and its methods of text generation-the rhetorical situation-to conceptualize prompt engineering in a more comprehensible way for its users by considering the context and rhetoric. We introduce a framework, consisting of a formula, to prompt engineering, which demands all components of the rhetorical situation be present in the inputted prompt. We present discussions on the future of AI writing models and their use in both professional and educational settings. Ultimately, this discussion and its findings aim to provide a means of integrating agency and writer-centric methods to AI writing tools to advance a more human-in-the-loop approach. As the use of generative AI and especially NLP-based technologies become common across societal functions, the use of prompt engineering will play a crucial role not just in adoption of the technology, but also its productive and responsible use.",SPRINGER,2025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-024-01905-3,,,,

Objective: This study aimed to identify barriers and enablers to data sharing for AI in health care in LMICs and to test the relevance of these in a local context. Methods: First, we conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, Web of Science, and ACM using controlled vocabulary. Primary research studies, perspectives, policy landscape analyses, and commentaries performed in or involving an LMIC context were included. Studies that lacked a clear connection to health information exchange systems or were not reported in English were excluded from the review. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts of the included articles and critically appraised each study. All identified barriers and enablers were classified according to 7 categories as per the predefined framework-technical, motivational, economic, political, legal and policy, ethical, social, organisational, and managerial. Second, we tested the local relevance of barriers and enablers in Thailand through stakeholder interviews with 15 academic experts, technology developers, regulators, policy makers, and health care providers. The interviewers took notes and analyzed data using framework analysis. Coding procedures were standardized to enhance the reliability of our approach. Coded data were reverified and themes were readjusted where necessary to avoid researcher bias. Results: We identified 22 studies, the majority of which were conducted across Africa (n=12, 55%) and Asia (n=6, 27%). The most important data-sharing challenges were unreliable internet connectivity, lack of equipment, poor staff and management motivation, uneven resource distribution, and ethical concerns. Possiblesolutions included improving IT infrastructure, enhancing funding, introducing user-friendly software, and incentivizing health care organizations and personnel to share data forAI-related tools. In Thailand, inconsistent data systems, limited staff time, low health data literacy, complex and unclear policies, and cybersecurity issues were important data-sharing challenges. Key solutions included building a conducive digital ecosystem-having shared data input platforms for health facilities to ensure data uniformity and to develop easy-to-understand consent forms, having standardized guidelines for data sharing, and having compensation policies for data breach victims. Conclusions:Although AI in LMICs has the potentialto overcome health inequalities, these countries face technical, political, legal, policy, and organizational barriers to sharing data, which impede effective AI development and deployment. When tested in a local context, most of these barriers were relevant. Although our findings might not be generalizable to other contexts, this study can be used by LMICs as a framework to identify barriers and strengths within their health care systems and devise localized solutions for enhanced data sharing.

With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven portfolio management, retail investors have the choice to utilize cutting-edge technology to manage their investment portfolios. This study analyzes and portrays the effects of factors influencing the adoption of financial robo-advisors (FRAs) among retail investors in India. A framework comprising eight constructs is proposed to understand FRA adoption. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze data from 387 respondents among Indian retail investors using the IBM SPSS AMOS version 28 software package. The results indicate that technology readiness and financial literacy are the two strongest predictors of the behavioral intention to adopt FRA. Additionally, this study provides empirical evidence that social influence and investor type are relevant determinants of customers' decisions to adopt FRA. This study provides managers with guidance on the target segment of consumers for FRA and insights into the drivers of adoption. It further highlights the importance of investor profiling beyond just demographics to improve adoption.",WILEY,2025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/isd2.12346,,,,

The pandemic underscored the unpredictable nature of clinical situations, reinforcing the need to involve patients in decisions about their health. In France, although SDM is supported by public policies and recommendations from the Health High Authority, its implementation remains inconsistent. Key barriers include cultural obstacles linked to a still paternalistic medical tradition, a lack of training for healthcare professionals in necessary communication techniques, and organizational constraints that make challenging the integration of SDM into daily practice challenging. The article emphasizes the importance of systematic training for healthcare professionals to enhance their skills to communicate risks and use decision aids effectively. These tools, such as digital applications and informational leaflets, are essential for improving patient satisfaction, quality of medical decisions, and treatment adherence. Furthermore, the emergence of a patient-centered culture and the enhancement of health literacy are identified as key facilitators for the adoption of SDM. In conclusion, the article suggests that overcoming current obstacles and promoting continuous training are essential to making SDM a standard practice in France, particularly in a context where uncertainty is ever-present.

A quantitative analysis of Device and system handling training to enable competent interactions with intelligent voice assistants,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR REPORTS,Article,Voice assistant; Device handling; Smart speaker; Voice-based artificial intelligence; E -Learning; Digital interaction literacy,"Intelligent voice assistants (IVAs), such as Siri or Alexa, are voice-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems that help users solve everyday tasks using voice commands. Users often have a superficial understanding of the full range of functions IVAs can be used for and how to use them effectively. Since higher knowledge of device and system handling is fundamental for positive interaction quality and self-determined use of IVAs, this study examines how training can contribute to the promotion of variables such as usage aspects, social perception, and self-determined interaction and how such training can be designed. Based on an established competence framework and the principles of learning psychology and media didactics, three online training modules were developed to strengthen the user's device and system handling competence, and their effects on the parameters of competent AI interaction were investigated. A total of 110 students took part in the three training studies. Results of dependent t-tests show that completing training modules improves device and system handling and increases the intention to use IVAs more self-determined. In detail, participants perceive IVAs as more useful, tend to be more explorative and indulgent, feel more competent to use IVAs, and perceive them as less disturbing. Overall, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of training in improving the perceived usefulness of IVAs, exploratory and indulgent behavioral intentions, and decreasing the disturbance of IVAs. This work has great potential for research and education to improve, explore, and advance user behavior and competent interaction with IVAs, as well as for broader AI applications.",ELSEVIER,2025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chbr.2025.100610,,,,

386,0,J,"Yu, JL; Yu, SQ; Chen, L",,,,,,Using hybrid intelligence to enhance peer feedback for promoting teacher reflection in video-based online learning,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,Article,classroom analysis; hybrid intelligence; large language model; peer feedback; reflection; video-based teacher learning,"Video-based teacher online learning enables teachers to engage in reflective practice by watching others' classroom videos, providing peer feedback (PF) and reviewing others' work. However, the quality and reliability of PF often suffer due to variations in teaching proficiency among providers, which limits its usefulness for reviewers. To improve the quality of PF, hybrid intelligence is a promising approach that enhances human evaluation with AI-based techniques. Thus, we developed a hybrid intelligence feedback (HIF) system, where PF is categorized and summarized by large language models (LLM), and accompanied with AI multimodal data analysis, all in accordance with a knowledge structure. To investigate the effectiveness of the HIF, we conducted a study involving 58 pre-service mathematics teachers. After their initial feedback provision on a classroom video, they were divided into two groups. One group received HIF, while the other received traditional PF. Both groups revised their initial feedback based on the same video with PF or HIF report, and were assigned two tasks, namely in-depth reflection and extensive reflection. We analysed the reflective writings generated in in-depth reflection using the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes taxonomy, and examined the diversity of teachers' attentions in extensive reflection using information entropy. Compared to traditional PF, our findings indicated that HIF (a) facilitated more comments added in feedback revision, (b) promoted multi-structural and extended abstract level thinking in in-depth reflection, (c) encouraged more diverse attentions in extensive reflection. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of HIF in enhancing PF to promote reviewers' reflection. This efficacy can be attributed to the utilization of LLM to identify common elements within PF, guided by the human knowledge-based framework, as well as the integration of data-driven evidence to complement PF.Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? Video-based teacher online learning allows teachers to reflect on their own or others' videos flexibly while providing and reviewing peer feedback using reflection tools. While the benefits of reflecting on one's own videos with peer feedback are widely recognized, there is limited empirical evidence supporting the advantages of reflecting on others' videos with peer feedback. The effectiveness of this process may be affected by the quality and reliability of the peer feedback provided. Using natural language processing techniques to enhance peer feedback can be feasible and effective. However, it is primarily used to address textual-level issues and is less effective in promoting professionalism. Multimodal data analysis has shown effectiveness in enhancing teaching behaviours and facilitating reflection. However, despite the widespread use of AI-based analysis on classroom videos, they often lack educational interpretations. Hybrid intelligence is a novel concept in learning science research, aiming to leverage both human and machine intelligence to enhance the overall effectiveness. What this paper adds? This study applied the concept of hybrid intelligence to video-based teacher learning by proposing a hybrid intelligence feedback (HIF) system, aiming to promote teachers' reflection on others' videos during the peer feedback review process. This study proposed the design of HIF module, where human peer feedback was enhanced by large language models, and machine data analysis was complemented with educational interpretations, all structured according to an expert knowledge structure. The results showed that the HIF was effective to stimulate teachers' higher-level thinking in in-depth reflection and enhanced the diversity of their attentions in extensive reflection. However, it may still be challenging for novices to comprehend and integrate newly noticed pedagogical strategies in the HIF with their internal knowledge structures during reflection. Implications for practice and/or policy With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, the utilization of large language models becomes more flexible and effective, enabling multitasking enhancement for peer feedback in collaboration with human's professional knowledge. Multimodal data analysis effectively collaborates with human observations by managing low-level observation aspects, allowing humans to concentrate on higher-level thinking guided by the educational interpretations. The effectiveness of the HIF system is influenced by teachers' pedagogical knowledge, prior feedback provision experience and data literacy. In the future research, these diversities need to be taken into account in the design of video-based PD incorporating HIF to assess its long-term efficacy.",WILEY,2025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13559,,,,

These innovations promise enhanced diagnostic precision, improved operational workflows, and more personalized patient care. However, the direct impact of AI on clinical outcomes, workflow efficiency, and nursing staff well-being requires further elucidation.Methods This integrative review synthesized findings from 18 studies published through November 2024 across diverse healthcare settings. Using the PRISMA 2020 and SPIDER frameworks alongside rigorous quality appraisal tools (MMAT and ROBINS-I), the review examined the multifaceted effects of AI integration in nursing. Our analysis focused on three principal domains: clinical advancements and patient monitoring, operational efficiency and workload management, and ethical implications.Results The review demonstrates that AI integration in nursing has yielded substantial clinical and operational benefits. AI-powered monitoring systems, including wearable sensors and real-time alert platforms, have enabled nurses to detect subtle physiological changes-such as early fever onset or pain indicators-well before traditional methods, resulting in timely interventions that reduce complications, shorten hospital stays, and lower readmission rates. For example, several studies reported that early-warning algorithms facilitated faster clinical responses, thereby improving patient safety and outcomes. Operationally, AI-based automation of routine tasks (e.g., scheduling, administrative documentation, and predictive workload classification) has streamlined resource allocation. These efficiencies have led to a measurable reduction in nurse burnout and improved job satisfaction, as nurses can devote more time to direct patient care. However, despite these benefits, ethical challenges remain prominent. Key concerns include data privacy risks, algorithmic bias, and the potential erosion of clinical judgment due to overreliance on technology. These issues underscore the need for robust ethical frameworks and targeted AI literacy training within nursing curricula.Conclusion This review demonstrates that AI integration holds transformative potential for nursing practice by enhancing both clinical outcomes and operational efficiency. However, to realize these benefits fully, it is imperative to develop robust ethical frameworks, incorporate comprehensive AI literacy training into nursing education, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration. Future longitudinal studies across varied clinical contexts are essential to validate these findings and support the sustainable, equitable implementation of AI technologies in nursing.
